            "description": "Wailin Storms - Sick City (Full Album) Originally formed in the unrelenting heat of Corpus Christi, Texas, Wailin Storms migrated east and ended up in Durham, North Carolina. Their sound is justly a mix of doom-punk and swampy rock, as elements of their prior and current surroundings culminate into a unique and volatile brew. Stamped with eerily dark and ominous vocal elements reminiscent of bluesy masters like Howlin’ Wolf and Samhain with emotive nods to Destruction Unit, Bauhaus, and Jesus Lizard, the band’s output is incessantly passionate and harrowing in its entirety. Like their name suggests, Wailin Storms‘ anthems lull you in with the rain’s deliberate pummel before violent gales punch you off your feet.  The seething, pulsing bass intro of \"Hurricane Trashwave\" gives way to devastating crescendos that punch you off your feet.\nLater, the deliberate prowl of “Night of the Long Nights” kicks off a fiery freakout before the song’s casket lid closes. From vocalist/guitarist Justin Storms’ contagious croons to his pointed barks, Wailin Storms are both the push and the pull of rock ‘n’ roll fury. The calm before, and the actual capital-S Storm itself.  Building off their striking One Foot in the Flesh Grave debut, Sick City still offers hints of Clockcleaner’s antagonistic rock, Southern Gothic post-punk, and Danzig’s dirty work in Samhain.  But where One Foot in the Flesh Grave was a severe tropical storm, Sick City is a full-tilt, Category 4 noise-rock squall. Snare drums clap like hurricane shutters on \"Foot of My Tongue\" as distorted guitar lines whip by in violent gales.  Unhinged howls in \"Clean Shirt\" flash like lightning bolts as a fusillade of reverb-drenched guitar chords pound like a cataract of rushing rain.\nSaying Wailin Storms wears its influences on its sleeve is obvious: The band's always owed more than a passing glance to The Gun Club and The Birthday Party; its bleak misanthropy and imposing histrionics recall Swans; its spacious song structures and sparse, cavernous textures bring to mind Young Widows. But on Sick City, Wailin Storms offers a more confident presentation of those contrasting influences.\nReview by Sean Fraiser https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2017/09/27/full-album-stream-midnight-ride-sick-city-wailin-storms/\n1.

            "description": "Temple of the Fuzz Witch - Red Tide (New Full Album)  Temple of the Fuzz Witch is a fuzzed out Doom band from Detroit. Red Tide is their new sophomore full length album.  Temple of the Fuzz Witch play a brand of Stoner Doom that is steam-rolling towards you, crushing you in slow-motion like a dry leaf under a heavy boot. Noah Bruner on vocals and guitar is a skilled six-string savage and his chill and somewhat fragile vocals counter the dry and heavy overall sound of bass, guitar and drums. Angel Morrison plays a vicious bass and Neal Morrison on drums slows the whole narrative down quite a bit with his dead slow pace. This is a band that play really fucking viscous, the songs creep, sneak and skulk forward, inch by inch they enter your ears and tear their hooks into your head.\nThe key ingredient on this darkly majestic album is riffs. As is often the case with strong metal, riffs are the story, and here they are vibrant and visceral. Underpinning the riffs, we are provided with a rock solid rhythm section of sometimes jaunty drums and meaty basslines. The haunting vocals, rife with bleak, poignant lyricism, are the needle in the vein pushing this concoction straight into your bloodstream. In addition, the album is full of nuance. Small moments of beauty within the pain that build a mountain of greatness.\n1.  Baphomet - 0:00\n2.  Cherenkov Light - 4:57\n3.  The Others - 10:27\n4.  Dead's Desire - 16:24\n5.

            "description": "Stone Cadaver - Stone Cadaver (Full Album) Formed in 2013 in Aarhus, Denmark, Stone Cadaver is the equivalent of a cannon that lays down a barrage of dirty 70s riffs fused with catchy slow paced grooves on the bleeding ears of the listener.  The recipe is as simple it is wholesome: Old school proto-metal guitar and distorted bass combine with organic drums to concoct a doom rock gumbo that is bound to fill that empty hole in your stomach.  The self titled debut album features heavy, 70s inspired doom rock with groovy metal influences and crushingly slow passages.  The pulsating riffs may evoke stoner, but their heavy crunch, mixed with a mounting sense of the malevolent, unabashedly throws the doom influence to the fore.  It’s stoner but colder – and as the name suggests – less desert…a lot more graveyard.\nOpener Black Magick may be a slow burner but is portent to the undulating riffage that spills out the speakers for the duration of Stone Cadaver, and through second track Blasted Earth, before detouring into the fast lane for Straightwheeler, which provides a rollicking, Motörhead moment.  Final track, the wickedly entitled Blasphemous Revelry, Lechery & Sorcery veers back into heavier, doom territory, combining crushing menace with an inescapable compulsion to get the neck muscles moving. For a debut release, Stone Cadaver have cultivated a sound that has a lot more to give.  Between the heavyweight, curvilinear riffs, the upfront, rowdy bass lines and undeniable devilish touch, Stone Cadaver is a satiating entity.\nReview by https://cursedreflektions.wordpress.com/2015/07/18/bandcampbiweekly-feat-stone-cadaver/\n1.

            "description": "Midnight Coven - Bewitched (Full Album) Midnight Coven is a one man project presenting the musical visions of Aaron Baker from Nova Scotia, Canada. On his Facebook and Bandcamp pages Baker describes the music as Rock/Metal/Multi-genre. What ever you finally decided to describe it as, it's definitely interesting. Yes, I mean that as a positive. . Baker/Midnight Coven have been quite prolific, “Bewitched” being the 10th release.  “Bewitched” contains 6 songs and clocks in at 48 minutes long. Let's get one thing straight right off the bat; Aaron Baker is a damn impressive songwriter.\nAs prolific as it seems he's been in releasing album material, the 6 songs presented here are really solid. This doesn't appear to be throw-away material, or released just for the sake of releasing. These songs have substance, and while we're at it, Baker has got chops. He's one heck of a musician. Guitar, keys, drums, bass and whatever else he's plugging in and slapping around; he plays all of it with apparent ease. The first track “Sinister” pointedly emphasizes this, with highlights of clever bass runs at the midpoint, and a melt your face guitar solo closing it out. “Blood On The Wall” leans heavily on a Sabbath vibe, but never to the exclusivity of losing it's own identity.\n“Midnight Summoning's” opening riff is pure evil, though the song suffers from it's production a bit too noticeably. Still, the structure of the song is outstanding, rendering the production complaint moot. “Corporate Slave” runs on an almost Judas Priest feel, yet again, it's merely suggestive as the song is all it's own.  Thankfully Baker seemed to save the best for last, with “Conditioned Nation” being pure fire and seems to have the best mix (especially vocal) of all the songs here. Midnight Coven's “Bewitched” is a really good album. It'll appeal to a wide range of heavy music fans, and I'd expect that if one was to play it amongst a crowd, there would be some definite inquires.\nReview by Dave Nowels http://www.metal-temple.com/site/catalogues/entry/reviews/cd_3/m_2/midnight-coven.htm\n1.

On his Facebook and Bandcamp pages Baker describes the music as Rock/Metal/Multi-genre. What ever you finally decided to describe it as, it's definitely interesting. Yes, I mean that as a positive. . Baker/Midnight Coven have been quite prolific, “Bewitched” being the 10th release.  “Bewitched” contains 6 songs and clocks in at 48 minutes long. Let's get one thing straight right off the bat; Aaron Baker is a damn impressive songwriter.",

Sam Pace and the Gilded Grit is an American Rock n’ Roll band from Austin, TX.  Influenced by blues, soul, roots, rock and reggae- the music grounds itself in groove, tenacity and feel. Sam Pace and the Gilded Grit have been making a name for themselves as a force to be reckoned with since their inception in 2011. As staples in the Austin music scene and road dogs famous for their relentless 50-city U.S. Tours- the band has an old school work ethic with the chops to match. Top-10 for Musician of the Year, Best Song, Best Album, Best Album Art, Best Rock Band, Best Blues/Soul/Funk Band and two years in a row for Best Guitar Player and Best Male Vocals.\nSam’s voice and guitar playing are the signatures of the sound. His booming baritone and soulful growl give the music a powerful edge; while his heavy, swinging guitar and thick, luscious tone has been described as “a marriage between Peter Green, early Clapton, and early Hendrix\". Down and dirty rock n’ roll is hard to come by these days, even more difficult for it to achieve the level of success Pace has.\n1.  Punch 'Em In The Ear - 0:00\n2.

            "description": "Crust - The Wake (New Full Album) Australian trio Crust bring their latest freak out jazz psych journey in the form of 'The Wake'. The world fizzles away long after we were happily merged and uploaded. Many centuries pass and the village bursts forth as a part of a new, sustainable ecosystem. Vine-like structures snake their way up the remains of people that are now nothing more than a memory whispering inside the wind.  However, something malevolent rumbles in the crimson waters. A reminder of the ghastly histories that continue to haunt us. There is no escaping the judgment of the one mind.\nYou traipse through your fickle life with no knowledge of the terrible majesty of suffering that awaits you in death. So, in a tortuous gesture, you feast on the deity that lays below, inflicting upon it hideous pain.  The wake they say is eternal bliss for all...but there is only the waiting.\n1.

The world fizzles away long after we were happily merged and uploaded. Many centuries pass and the village bursts forth as a part of a new, sustainable ecosystem. Vine-like structures snake their way up the remains of people that are now nothing more than a memory whispering inside the wind.  However, something malevolent rumbles in the crimson waters. A reminder of the ghastly histories that continue to haunt us. There is no escaping the judgment of the one mind.",

With the first eerie organ tones that slowly rise off of their newest album \"Dayburner\" you can immediately feel a dark presence come over you that will not leave. Filled with occult-inspired doom metal that will have your head swimming the album is an overwhelming source of wicked, swirling darkness that will have your hair standing on end. It balances airy, bewitching vocals that will set your soul free to float in the ether with a low, rumbling backend that holds the weight of the void and makes the world tremble. It is as though the reaper walks among us and the band does his bidding. Spacey guitar solos and trippy touches will have your mind crawling through the heavy crashing riffage, burdened by visions of ghostly spirits pulling you towards the abyss.\nThe album taken as a whole is phenomenal, but there's a few bits that I keep listening to over and over - the chilling introduction on \"Mourning Sun\" bursting into that hard, gloomy riff with paranormal stirrings, the eerie chanting of 'follow me, follow me' at the end of \"Orphic\", and the acoustic segment at the beginning of the title track that will give you goose bumps and flashbacks to Elephant Tree's self-titled album. Everyone's comparing these guys to Windhand - and that's fair - but if that's all you're getting out of Dayburner you're not letting it consume you fully! You must drink from the seas of reverb, allow the black haze to overtake you, and bask in the pale spectral glow!\nReview by Brandon https://superdankmetaljams.blogspot.com/2018/07/haunted-dayburner-2018.html?m=1\n1.

            "description": "Robot God - Silver Buddha Dreaming (New Full Album) Robot God are a Psych Space Stoner Rock band from Sydney Australia who offer a powerful blend of space rock, traditional stoner and psychedelia. Silver Buddha Dreaming is their debut album.  This original 3-piece consists of Matt Allen on bass guitar, Tim Pritchard on drums and Raff Iacurto on guitar. These three seasoned musicians have a cosmic connection and together they have created a mammoth live set which delivers a monstrous wall of sound and a spiritual experience all at the same time. The trio effortlessly blend experimental space jams with elements of traditional stoner rock and doom to create a musical journey that is both powerful and haunting.  Fans of Hendrix, Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd, Earthless, The Atomic Bitchwax and Elder won't be disappointed.\nRobot God take song writing to the next level with many unexpected twists and turns, a lush fuzz filled soundscape greets the listeners senses for an out of body experience that you will want to relive time and time again. On the live front Robot God have shared the stage with some legendary local and international acts such as Greenleaf (Sweden), Rollerball, Arrowhead and Jack Harlon and the Dead Crows. Robot Gods journey is just beginning but the road these guys have traveled over the last year has them set and ready to blow people’s minds in the years to come. If you’re a lover of spaced out blues jams mixed with Sabbath inspired riffage you will soon find yourself falling under Robot Gods magical spell. Prepare for the future, become a believer and let Robot God show you the way to the promised land, and you will see what all the fuzz is about.\n1.  Silver Buddha Dreaming - 0:00\n2.

Try to travel with your mind: back in time, desert lands, cactus, dusty roads and a long journey.  Think of stopping somewhere beautiful at the end of the trip refreshing your soul with a cold beer and a breathtaking landscape view \"...From The Earth To The Sky\" is the perfect soundtrack for a mind travel or a real journey on a hot hot summertime day. Acoustic and electric guitars, percussion, banjo and pedal steel mixed with mellow vocals that let you dream away. This is the band’s sophomore album and is composed of 14 songs.\nThe first part of the album is inspired by a classic country attitude mixed with a spaghetti western sound. The rest of the album presents different moments, while conjuring up atmospheres reminiscent of Santana, The Eagles, Crosby Stills Nash and Young, Spirit, Captain Beyond and recent Motorpsycho, we can simply file the genre under: Acoustic, Melodic, Psychedelic Folk. The first album \"Walking into the Forest\" has been a surprise success while selling out in 1 year and receiving the attention of many devoted followers who are waiting impatiently for the second chapter.  Compared to the first album \"...From The Earth To The Sky And Back\" has improved the production, there are more songs arranged with drums and the the album has been mixed and mastered by Shane Trimble.\n1.

A morose and beautiful expression of blackened funeral doom. The duration is perfect, neither too short nor too long.  A hearkening back to blackened doom metal like Estatic Fear, Mádra produces eloquent passages of gorgeous instrumentation that leave one enrapt in a fragile sorrow.\nThe project started in the summer of 2019 with Haenesy members, complemented by Tamás Galántay, known from Slytract. The basic concept was to create uncompromising audio materials without giving concerts, trying to focus on the musical creative process. An album where different choirs, piano and distorted guitars are pushed into the background. This is complemented by the analog recorded drums, which give a special sound to the album. Analogue recording and self mixing was a conscious decision, preserving the uniqueness of the sound. The vocal parts are characterized by veiled, yelling in the background, the lyrics recall the tribulations of the past. H. was responsible for recording the guitars and vocals. The drums were recorded by T..there are some church mantras in the songs that give a sacred dimension to the songs. Repositioning the listener in the old days, when it was determined most by God and faith\n1.  Depart pt. I - 0:00\n2.  Into The Long Fade - 2:32\n3.  Where Once She Stood - 11:46\n4.  Depart pt.

            "summary": "ÖfÖ Am - The Beast Within (Full Album) ÖfÖ Am is an instrumental heavy rock band from France.  Influenced by bands ranging from Deep Purple to Unsane through Black Sabbath and Kyuss, ÖfÖ AM has chosen to remain instrumental and focus each of its pieces around a central theme.  Each musical piece is written as a soundtrack for a story or a fictitious movie (B movie, western, SF, horror, stuff like that).  The Beast Within is their debut album, which was released in 2011. OfO AM have created a more exciting instrumental album than most heavy bands ever could. It's avantgarde, surf metal, progged out riffs and licks, psych tremeloed, Crime and features killer Sabbath moments we live for",

This is his self titled debut full length album, released in 2017 and recently remastered. Over an hour of super sonic fuzz worship and monstrous guitar tones.  A heavy psych steamroller.  What ties these tracks together is a heavy fuzzed out sludgy sound. But there is also a real diversity to the tracks. Condena Natural and Corre are very heavy, and Vudú Masivo gets even louder. But there are also tracks like La Verdad and Lucidez which contain less heavy sections and more sedate vocals.\n1.  Caerás - 0:00\n2.  Wild Indian - 7:54\n3.  La Verdad - 11:44\n4.  Lucidez - 21:26\n5.  Divergencia - 27:58\n6.  Condena Natural - 38:40\n7.  Herradura (Hojas Egoístas) - 45:58\n8.  Vudú Masivo - 49:23\n9.

            "summary": "Humanotone - Humanotone (Full Album) Humanotone is a one man band from Chile comprised of Jorge Cisternas M. This is his self titled debut full length album, released in 2017 and recently remastered. Over an hour of super sonic fuzz worship and monstrous guitar tones.  A heavy psych steamroller.  What ties these tracks together is a heavy fuzzed out sludgy sound. But there is also a real diversity to the tracks. Condena Natural and Corre are very heavy, and Vudú Masivo gets even louder. But there are also tracks like La Verdad and Lucidez which contain less heavy sections and more sedate vocals.",

They are independent artists from Varna, Bulgaria who record, mix and master their instrumental music all by themselves. Oddplay are very happy to share their music with all fans of the genre.  Soundscape is their latest full length album, their 3rd of the year.  It is a dark, psychedelic wonder perfect for a late-night drive or simply when you are in the mood for something heavy but sensual, melodic but odd.\nThe album is entirely instrumental, letting you savour every emphatic strum of the guitar and the groovy bass. Some tracks feel like bringing you into a cerebral psychedelic experience, while others convey the grit and tremor of something more old-school. Some of them may also feel kind of light-hearted and melodic, as if watching a beautiful sunset during the first day of a desolate apocalypse. This all makes for a very unique and cathartic listening experience as the album weaves each subsequent track into a wonderful malady of styles and vibes.\n1.  Chasing Odds - 0:00\n2.

            "description": "Zeit - Drangsal (Full Album) Drangsal is the latest album from German commandos Zeit.  Their mixture of bleak traditional black metal and some sludge/doom elements is still in place.  The goal of Zeit is to blend contrasting elements, melancholy and aggression, pain and pleasure. A lot of bands throw these kinds of statements out and it often comes across like a pale attempt at making sense of a whole lot of noise. One spin through “Drangsal” shows that these Germans have an idea how to work their heady conceits into solid heavy music. The typical tremolo picks and the pummeling blasts can be found here as well and build the basis of Zeit’s music. While each black metal band puts a lot of emphasis on building a sinister atmosphere they have gone even a bit further compared to their peers.\nMelancholic and trippy guitar harmonies are often dwelling in the background while the stoic and hypnotic basic chords are responsible for a dense atmosphere. The fascinating chord progressions are accompanied by melodic trademark lead lines defining the character of each single song. The speed and the intensity are kept high over the majority of the album with only a few passages where the tempo is slowed down and the listener gets a chance to breathe. However, the memorable harmonies and the fantastic hooks make the record a very enjoyable affair.\nBeside the spectacular guitar work also the rhythm section has to be mentioned. The drumming is precise following the main patterns of each song and highlighting several sections where an extra portion of intensity is needed. Most of the time it is kept pretty laid-back underlining the quite stoic and atmospheric nature of the music. A gloomy atmosphere is something that is very important for this record and thankfully it has been taken care that things never get too hectic or chaotic to destroy the mood. Although the instrumental skills are obvious most emphasis has been put on a stringent and clearly structured songwriting.\nThe vocals delivered by Fur are perfectly fitting coming across desperate and haunting. The production is thick and heavy but there is enough room to breathe for each instrument. Despite the rawness no detail has been lost in the mix and can be noticed while carefully listening. Drangsal is a must-have for collectors of aggressive yet captivating music.\nReview by Edmund Sackbauer https://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Zeit/Drangsal/787290/\n1.  Schweigen - 0:00\n2.

            "description": "Temple Of The Fuzz Witch - Temple Of The Fuzz Witch (Full Album) Hailing from Detroit, Michigan, Temple Of The Fuzz Witch is everything you might imagine that name implies, and then some.  If you dig affectionate Wizard-worship and narcotic fuzz-crazed haze, then this album is going to be your jam for damn sure.  A strong current of Electric Wizard runs through the self-titled debut full-length from Detroit’s Temple of the Fuzz Witch (on Seeing Red Records), but even to that, the outfit led by guitarist/vocalist Noah Bruner bring a nascent measure of individuality, droning into and through “Death Hails” after opening with “Bathsheba” and ahead of unveiling a harmonized vocal on “The Glowing of Satan” that suits the low end distortion surprisingly well.\nThey continue to offer surprises throughout, whether it’s the spaciousness of centerpiece “329” and “Infidel,” which follows, or the offsetting of minimalism and crush on “The Fuzz Witch” and the creeper noise in the ending of “Servants of the Sun,” and though there are certainly familiar elements at play, Temple of the Fuzz Witch come across with an intent to take what’s been done before and make it theirs. In that regard, they would seem to be on the right track, and in their 41 minutes, they find footing in a murky aesthetic and are able to convey a sense of songwriting without sounding heavy-handed.\nReview by from The Obelisk http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/tag/temple-of-the-fuzz-witch/\n1.

If you dig affectionate Wizard-worship and narcotic fuzz-crazed haze, then this album is going to be your jam for damn sure.  A strong current of Electric Wizard runs through the self-titled debut full-length from Detroit’s Temple of the Fuzz Witch (on Seeing Red Records), but even to that, the outfit led by guitarist/vocalist Noah Bruner bring a nascent measure of individuality, droning into and through “Death Hails” after opening with “Bathsheba” and ahead of unveiling a harmonized vocal on “The Glowing of Satan” that suits the low end distortion surprisingly well.",

Chicago has a long history of esteemed punk bands, but few are like Protovulcan. Somewhere between proto-metal, garage rock, sci-fi sounds and art-punk, Psychic Pinball will confuse, mesmerize, and maybe even inspire you.\nSinister madness conjured from several vintage synths, hyperactive drumming, and trusty old vocoders. Synth-punk (or -prog, or -psych) made by robots whose main desire is to crush all the puny humans. Think the center of a Venn diagram between Servotron and Black Moth Super Rainbow. It’s definitely not as hazy as the latter, but there’s far more of a groove to it than the former. It’s pretty dystopian, but also kind of funky at points (see “Waking Up Dinosaurs”). “Celestial Slingshot” will make you feel trapped in a satellite hurdling across the galaxy as far from Earth as possible, and it’ll be supremely exciting.\n1.

            "summary": "Protovulcan - Psychic Pinball (Full Album) Rumoured to be “demented instrumental acid-rock with robotic melodies that sound like party music from an episode of Doctor Who\" or \"a three-way tug-of-war between frisky, soulful garage rock, frenetic funk, and swaggering 70s proto-metal\" - Protovulcan is actually just Deric Criss (Aleks and the Drummer, Walking Bicycles) on drums and Will MacLean (formerly of Mercury Rev offshoot Variety Lights) on moog bass, wurlitzer, and vocoder, and Travers Gauntt (Velcro Lewis Group) on guitar.  Chicago has a long history of esteemed punk bands, but few are like Protovulcan. Somewhere between proto-metal, garage rock, sci-fi sounds and art-punk, Psychic Pinball will confuse, mesmerize, and maybe even inspire you.",

            "description": "Die Ego - Culto (New Full Album) London based heavy metal trio Die Ego have come forth with their brutal full-length debut album, ‘Culto’.  This is a remarkable release that's going to sate the thirst of many a Metalhead with these songs of blistering brutality.  The title track \"Culto\" opens up this eight-track beastie, with Drum's and Guitar riffs to scare and intimidate a horde of Rottweilers, the guys deliver an opening track with menace as we get drawn into \"Anger Is Yours\"  sounding like the bastard child of Pantera, Slipknot and Metallica these Rockers continue to batter your head with an iron bar.  \"Demons have Demons\" is venomous and dangerous like a wounded snake in a sea of fire.\n\"Treatment of Silence\" is vicious and acidic with its intensity, a groove Metal feels that's highly hypnotic with its vibes embedding themselves into you, it's so powerful as Diego lets fly on his lead Guitar and  Daves Drums resonate while having a kick about in ya head! This is the kind of opus that gets your attention from the get-go as \"There Is No Tomorrow\" grips you around the throat, spins you around the room with its stomach-churning groove, hell yeah!  There really is no compromise on \"Culto\" as \"The Grave\" digs deep into your soul with its unnerving delivery, this would fit nicely on a horror flick.\nThe pounding and neck straining \"Don Get Close\" works its magic, it has you banging your head and singing the chorus in no time.  Final track \"I Promise\" runs at nearly seven minutes and brings to a close an exemplary debut from Die Ego. Without a doubt we will be hearing more from this band with a rapidly growing fan base, this platter will electrify you.  Believe me when I say All Hell's breaking loose in London.\nReview by Seb Di Gatto https://www.themetgodsmeltdown.com/die-ego-culto\n1.  Culto - 0:00\n2.  Anger is Yours - 5:21\n3.

A three piece very much in the vein of Mötorhead, they’re a no-nonsense bunch who deliver a bawdy, ballsy brand of rock that will appeal to fans right across the heavy rock spectrum. They produce a stripped-down sound that’s devoid of any frill; it’s just pure impact. Wild Road Rollers sit with the best trios (Anvil, Budgie, ZZ Top) and deliver an equally punchy sound.\nOpening salvo ‘I Should Be In Hell’ arrives like an avalanche and proceeds to swing like a huge wrecking ball. Rick Dickman’s bass is delivered with a ground shaking rumble and it’s underpinned by the marching army that is Albert Boni's drumming. Guitarist and vocalist Lou Angelson has a nice throaty rasp that’s not dissimilar to Anvil’s Lips and it all adds up to a volatile admixture. The aptly titled ‘Fire Thunderbomb’ crashes in like a fiery comet upon entering the Earths atmosphere and causes havoc like Thor throwing around lightning bolts. With the throttled constantly revved ‘Road Bastards’ is the soundtrack for an invading biker army and stomps with a huge monolithic sound that Black Sabbath would be proud of. The bluesy solo that erupts mid song is a thing of beauty and drips with Southern Fried goodness. ‘Hangover Day’ takes it foot off the pedal for a power metal cut but don’t worry; it’s more Skynyrd than Jovi.\n‘Green Illusions’ is another stomper that’s wrapped up in a circling maelstrom which points to a space rock vibe and is akin to a four minute, brutal beatdown. ‘Desert Chaos’ is hard and heavy yet infused with a strong melody. The pounding drums and bass are interspersed with bluesy noodling, with each acting as a foil to the other. Patiently building a brutalist sonic structure ‘Rocker God’ is simply a huge Tower of Babel that rises above the listener and threatens to topple and crush with its enormity. ‘Restless’ finds the band back on familiar ground and rocks along like a fusion of Black Label Society and Down.\nWild Road Rollers debut EP (‘Dirty Rock n’ Roll Brew’) was released back in 2017 and ‘Imperial Stout Motor Oil’ features three tracks from that release, rerecorded; this records opening cut (‘I Should Be In Hell’) and these last two tracks. ‘No Brother Left Behind’ and closer, the all out rocker ‘Before I Count To Three’.  It’s interesting to compare how the band have evolved over the years, becoming fuller, more confident and much harder and punchier.\nReview by Peter Dennis https://www.themidlandsrocks.com/wild-road-rollers-imperial-stout-motor-oil/\n1.

Bad Trip Exorcism is their debut album, released in 2019. With the help of a magic spell book written in the blood of a young virgin, supported by a large portion of marijuana and a huge guitar in his hands, he expels the spirits tormenting the people. Hypnotizing drums are put into trance, revealing the darkest corners of the subconscious.  At their call, evil spirits are led and climb out of their holes. They can not resist the weight of the guitar and disappear in its slow and heavy sound. And if you are harassed by evil spirits, it is time to listen to the album \"Bad Trip Exorcism\" and to conduct your own exorcism.\n1.  Holy Gila Monster - 0:00\n2.  Dope Witch - 11:42\n3.

Bad Trip Exorcism is their debut album, released in 2019. With the help of a magic spell book written in the blood of a young virgin, supported by a large portion of marijuana and a huge guitar in his hands, he expels the spirits tormenting the people. Hypnotizing drums are put into trance, revealing the darkest corners of the subconscious.  At their call, evil spirits are led and climb out of their holes. They can not resist the weight of the guitar and disappear in its slow and heavy sound. And if you are harassed by evil spirits, it is time to listen to the album \"Bad Trip Exorcism\" and to conduct your own exorcism.",

This time around there is electric bass which really thickens everything up and adds another harmonic layer. Overall, this time everything was pushed way harder. The rhythms, polymeters, arrangements, harmonies and melodies are just taking it up a notch or two and his one really feels like Zeitgeber is supposed to sound.\nWhere Zeitgeber’s debut album ‘Heteronomy’ focused on chronobiology - the hidden forces and environmental stimuli that regulate and modulate human behaviour - ‘Random Crushing Forces’ take a broader view. Steeped in the philosophy of Alan Watts, the EP explores the interconnected nature of the universe, and the arbitrary nature of both boundaries and dualist/binary categories.  Musically, Zeitgeber utilize a wide range of instrumentation, including handpan, guitar, bass, harmonium, didgeridoo, whirly tube, clarinet, viola, bass clarinet, krakebs and much more. The majority of these instruments were played, recorded and layered by Zeitgeber’s creator Evan McGregor.\nWith ‘Transforming The Random Crushing Forces Of The Universe Into Manageable Patterns’, Zeitgeber have expanded their sonic palette while further refining their compositional style. As the oscillating polyrhythms work to slowly draw the listener into a trance-like state, the music begins to slowly unfold with an unhurried, lush and organic feel. The result is a wonderfully creative release, and a highpoint for Australian progressive and instrumental music.\n1.  1010110 - {Self}\n2.  1010110 - {Other}\n3.  11010 - {Self}\n4.  11010 - {Other}\nSupport Zeitgeber by purchasing the EP here https://zeitgeber-aus.bandcamp.com/album/transforming-the-random-crushing-forces-of-the-universe-into-manageable-patterns\nhttps://www.facebook.com/zeitgeberband",

            "description": "CHROMB! - Le Livre des Merveilles (New Full Album) CHROMB! is a quartet with strings, reeds, 88 keys and drums in, wired on 220volts, making rock with no guitar, distorted jazz or chamber music for sick kids and emotive adults. CHROMB!'s music is heartfelt more than brain-made, has no prohibition and is the prisoner of no specific style.  CHROMB! makes its own music, preferring continuous renewal to stabilizing labeling; the quartet’s fuel is a mixture of inventiveness and generosity, which has been spreading over the last ten years on a variety of stages, from international festivals to places of underground culture. CHROMB! is a member of Dur et Doux, a collective/label dedicated to unclassifiable music based in Lyon.\nCHROMB!’s discography shows its openness: while album I (2012) laid the supersonic foundations of the band through open and collective writing, its successor II (2014) digested the dense and electric energy of intensive touring. Next comes 1000 (2016), a dense and labyrinthine album where hyper-writing and vocal polyphonies are integrated into the band’s favorite ingredients. Finally, Le Livre Des Merveilles (2020), echoes the travel stories of Gervais de Tilbury (1150-1218): there are songs that tell, and instrumental pieces that evoke, with a slowness and sound places that the band had never visited before.\nIn 2019, CHROMB! launched into the writing of a new repertoire populated by synthetic insects and traversed by an insane energy: the writing leaves as much room for irresistible riffs for the body as it does for the slow development of sound masses that speak to the skull, stealing the energies of the freest music, whether experimental or danceable. The four tracks, inspired by a fantasized mythology that J.L. Borges would not have disavowed, let eventually the light come through… Between medievalism and futurism, the lyrics in French, make use of playful hermeticism and smash the rules to pieces. Less acidic, more structured, the style asserts itself, more and more epic as it is ornament-less. Labyrinthine tales with sinuous vocal parts here, a noisy symphony there: with Le Livre Des Merveilles, the incredible gives way to the fabulous… Then, in the distance, the truth bursts out.\nReview by Olav Martin Bjørnsen https://houseofprog.com/blog/2020/02/13/chromb-set-to-release-le-livre-des-merveilles/\n1.

Enjoy as the sequential songs will explore multiple musical influences.  This is their self titled debut album, released in 2017.   Soothing, ghostly, and curiously warm. The songs tend to start small and, after layers of ascending buildup and transitional sections, finally finish enormously; righteously grooving all the way to the terminus. The gratuitous usage of icy reverb and clean guitars bring this characteristic out the most and are juxtaposed beautifully with thick and crunchy stoneriffic riffs.\n1.  Propeller - 0:00\n2.

            "summary": "The White Flies - The White Flies (Full Album) The White Flies is an Instrumental Heavy Rock project from South Brazil that converges the aggressive vibes of stoner rock/metal with some lush psychedelia and shoegaze's deep, relaxing vibes. Enjoy as the sequential songs will explore multiple musical influences.  This is their self titled debut album, released in 2017.   Soothing, ghostly, and curiously warm. The songs tend to start small and, after layers of ascending buildup and transitional sections, finally finish enormously; righteously grooving all the way to the terminus. The gratuitous usage of icy reverb and clean guitars bring this characteristic out the most and are juxtaposed beautifully with thick and crunchy stoneriffic riffs.",

Double Cross is a Heavy Metal band from Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais - Brazil. Heavily inspired in bands such as Mercyful Fate, Venom, Motorhead, among others within this genre, Double Cross has been able to shape their sound mixing the old school rawness with modern traces. Your lyric themes dialogues with darkness, profanity and existentialist themes. The band relies in the experience of active musicians in the Brazilian heavy music scene with musicians who also have been in bands such: Divine Death, Preceptor, Godalien, Broken Spell, Impurity, Wisache.\nAfter a few months of composition between Alex Albernaz and Thiag Brotão, the lineup was completed in mid-2019 with the arrival of drummer Ghuzz. Recorded alive and produced by the band and producer Rodrigo Grillo at Solo Studio in Belo Horizonte, and later on mixed and mastered by Dennis Israel, the EP condenses the musical approach proposed by the band and its members.\n1.

            "description": "Wailin Storms - Rattle (New Full Album) Like a summer hurricane, Durham, North Carolina foursome Wailin Storms deliver their shape shifting new full length album, 'Rattle'.  Bracing the elements head-on and wearing influences of grunge, doom, punk, rock, and blues on their sleeves, Wailin Storms create a unique perfect storm of unhinged sophistication and moody textures laced within each seductively psychedelic, country-twanged vignette.  Listening to “Grass” feels briefly like encountering a ghost. Vocalist Justin Storms sounds at once tormented and possessed, singing his haunted song of a man doomed to live out his misery over and over again. His voice carries the gothic quiver of Woven Hand/16 Horsepower’s David Eugene Edwards, and Storms has said that Baptist hymns and Alan Lomax field recordings inspired his eerie chants. But the end result still feels like something beyond the corporeal realm.\nStorms’ voice is a defining characteristic of Wailin Storms’ psychedelic, bluesy sludge-rock. The North Carolina band never operate at anything less than full throttle, and their abrasive scrape puts a distinctly Southern, supernatural spin on the kind of meaty, burly violence that Unsane and Oxbow have made their signature. So once the band gets moving on Rattle, Wailin Storms’ J. Robbins-recorded third album and first for Gilead Media, the walls start closing in, the horizon begins rotating, and the sledgehammer begins to come crashing through. Rattle is a refinement and purification of sorts of the gothic noise rock sound that began on the band’s 2015 debut, One Foot on the Flesh Grave. Their compositions are tighter, their aesthetics are more refined, and its eight tracks all carry a bluesy groove that never gets lost in spite of the relentless pursuit of impact and agony.\nThe title track feels utterly massive, but moves at a lurch rather than a sprint, the menace always palpable, always present, even when Wailin Storms take a mid-song moment to let the space and feedback linger. At times the band evokes the heaviest end of grunge, such as Melvins or Alice in Chains, when creeping their way through a beastly anthem like “Wish,” though these songs feel too terrifying, too bleak to ever fit in alongside anything from Singles. Sewing together a blend of Old Testament wails and burly noise rock could come across as gimmicky, even corny under the wrong circumstances, but Wailin Storms never give anything less than a convincingly possessed performance.\nAll of this being said, there’s a great deal of melody on Rattle, and a momentum that’s undeniably infectious. Standout “Teeth” has a driving pulse that feels as much like an ominous permutation of shoegaze as it does metal or noise rock, and the stoner-goth of “Sun” punches like Queens of the Stone Age at full power. All the while, Storms delivering his venomous sermons, turning these furious anthems slightly more antagonistic. It’s easy to get caught up in the riffs and the rumble, but at the front of each of these songs is a soothsayer with a mouth of brimstone. Wailin Storms have the chops and aesthetic to take over as house band at the Gates of Hell, and they’re putting on a hell of a show.\nAfter all, it’s hard not to reach the conclusion that those gates are wide open, and the lock’s broken off. Coronavirus, murder hornets, an economic meltdown—intentional or not, Wailin Storms arrived at exactly the right time to be delivering chilling noise-blues dirges of doom. Though this was recorded prior to any pandemic predictions, the doom and pessimism is precisely the point. Storms said that the album is “about feeling hopeless in a world that is very broken to me,” and by the time the gale-force psychedelia of “Crow” and the jagged Delta sludge of “End” run their course, listening to Rattle feels a bit like having participated in an octathlon of Biblical plagues. It’s a necessary exorcism, a cathartic shout of hopelessness intended to give some power back, no matter how exhausting it feels.\nReview by Jeff Terich https://www.treblezine.com/album-of-the-week-wailin-storms-rattle-review/\n1.

Bracing the elements head-on and wearing influences of grunge, doom, punk, rock, and blues on their sleeves, Wailin Storms create a unique perfect storm of unhinged sophistication and moody textures laced within each seductively psychedelic, country-twanged vignette.  Listening to “Grass” feels briefly like encountering a ghost. Vocalist Justin Storms sounds at once tormented and possessed, singing his haunted song of a man doomed to live out his misery over and over again. His voice carries the gothic quiver of Woven Hand/16 Horsepower’s David Eugene Edwards, and Storms has said that Baptist hymns and Alan Lomax field recordings inspired his eerie chants. But the end result still feels like something beyond the corporeal realm.",

            "description": "Excantation - Pilgrimage of the Imperator (Full Album) From hot, humid San Antonio, Texas, come Funeral Doom behemoths Excantation, with their sophomore full-length release, 'Pilgrimage of the Imperator'. Sun-drenched their home town may be, but their dirge-like soundscapes are darker and colder than the inside of a Reykjavik sarcophagus on a particularly bleak January night. Through four bruising, epic tracks - each one clocking in at approximately ten minutes - Excantation deliver a lesson in the expression of pure undiluted sorrow. A musical tunnel without even the slightest chink of light no matter how far ahead you look; a crushing, monolithic beast that will extinguish any spark foolish enough to dare attempt to kindle in its presence.\nOpening track, 'Insurmountable Lapse', sets the tone of the album with the subtlety of a falling tombstone to the face; bleak, punishing and brutal from the very first seconds. A down-tempo dirge of droning distortion and melancholy synths, with bellowed vocals harsh enough to strip the paint from a brand-new coffin, it drags the listener into a world of wounded feelings and endless lamentation. Lyrics are largely unintelligible, but the anguish of the delivery, and the grinding, synth-laden music paint an unmistakable picture; monochrome and frightening, bled of all color to create an unsettling, but fascinating atmosphere.\nTracks merge seamlessly as the album progresses, often making it difficult to easily ascertain where one ends and the other begins. The result is four roughly equal songs that combine to create something greater than their individual parts; one long, well-balanced funerary voyage over the edge of the abyss. Moving along at a slow, imperious tempo, it brought to my mind Paulie Cicero, the mafioso colossus of the Scorsese movie, Goodfellas, who, film buffs will recall 'may have moved slow, but it was only because Paulie didn't have to move for anybody'.\n'Pilgrimage of the Imperator' not an album that will necessarily hook the listener on first listen, but it will reward further listening. It can feel impenetrable at times, but with repeat listening, ideally to the full album in its entirety, nuances will reveal themselves, and the crushing trip to the darker parts of the human soul can be fully appreciated.   It's not an easy listen, but on this sophomore release, Excantation have demonstrated poise and confidence, and created an album filled with sombre grandeur. Grim and uncompromising from its brutal opening seconds to an ending so abrupt you'll wonder if your cd player, or whatever other device you may use to feed your Doom addiction has died, it's a deep, powerful expression of Funeral Doom.\nReview by Nick Harkins http://www.doom-metal.com/reviews.php?album=3340\n1.

Through four bruising, epic tracks - each one clocking in at approximately ten minutes - Excantation deliver a lesson in the expression of pure undiluted sorrow. A musical tunnel without even the slightest chink of light no matter how far ahead you look; a crushing, monolithic beast that will extinguish any spark foolish enough to dare attempt to kindle in its presence.",

The band features Ryan Tyler, guitar/vocals, Travis Flood, vocals; and Brett Gallant, drums. Their connection is as Southwest Oklahoma as the crunching mesquite stomp riffs and windblown atmospherics that make their music something special.  This is their self titled debut EP.  These five songs follow a lonely gunslinger on his quest for immortality, From 'Chasing the Coyote,’ to facing his death in the song ‘End Of a Gunslinger.’  Upon escaping, he takes refuge with a ‘Medicine Man’ who takes him to the spirit land where he comes in contact with the eater of worlds, the ‘Holy Serpent.’ With his wish granted for immortality granted it doesn’t come without cost. He is forced to spend eternity doing the bidding of the serpent as the mythical ‘Wendigo.’”  This EP has heavy doom, blues and grunge influence with a tinge of stoner rock thrown in there.\nReview by Scott Rains https://www.swoknews.com/styles/chasing-the-coyote-leads-to-mighty-music/article_3040da4e-d63c-539e-8ada-9cf370a39b1a.html\n1.

            "description": "Mangoo - Neolithic (Full Album) In the dull musical climate of today Mangoo represents something truly unique and fresh. In their own private atmosphere of Rock awesomeness they are the ones orchestrating the weather, and the forecast is more than pleasant.  Catchy hooks and sweet vocal harmonies backed by a wall of thick fuzzy guitars and hard hitting drums with an added sprinkling of analog synth sounds, combined they result in a truly unique sound. Stoner rock, psychedelic hard rock, space rock or maybe it's just best described as Mangoo.\nHailing from Turku, Finland, Mangoo have been busting out the fuzz since 2005 when they released their untitled debut EP.  Countless beers, headaches, shows and drummers later the first full-length, Neolithic (7:45 Records); was released in 2009, receiving nothing but excellent reviews and radio airtime. Relentless and successful touring in support of the album in their native Finland followed the next years.  Since then the line-up has remained unchanged with Pickles playing guitar and singing, Mattarn busting out more guitar riffs, Igor slaying on the bass, Teemu pounding away at the drums and Nicke playing keys and just generating weird noises.\n1.

            "summary": "Mangoo - Neolithic (Full Album) In the dull musical climate of today Mangoo represents something truly unique and fresh. In their own private atmosphere of Rock awesomeness they are the ones orchestrating the weather, and the forecast is more than pleasant.  Catchy hooks and sweet vocal harmonies backed by a wall of thick fuzzy guitars and hard hitting drums with an added sprinkling of analog synth sounds, combined they result in a truly unique sound. Stoner rock, psychedelic hard rock, space rock or maybe it's just best described as Mangoo.",

            "description": "Haunted - Haunted (Full Album) Formed in the gray and depressive Fall of 2015, some dark appearances from Catania, Italy - willing to channel their existential void into musical form.  Haunted propose a heavy doom of sub-sabbathian ancestry bleached by ethereal keening and monolithic riffage. Like many of their fellow Italian Doom Metal acts, Haunted plays slow and dark tunes, musically inspired by Black Sabbath and Italian underground legend Paul Chain. Their lyrics are influenced by the imaginary associated with occultism and witchcraft. Beside their musical influences, they’re in big debt with the aesthetic of classic Italian horror movies.\nThe album starts with “Nightbreed”, a song that sets the tone for the next 43 minutes:  almost 9 minutes of dark, down-tuned and slow riffs accompanied by ethereal and enigmatic singing. “Watchtower”  hits you in the chest since the beginning, thanks to the somber pulse created by the distorted bass and the hard hitting drums. The song evolves with repetitive patterns, kinda like the ones used by indigenous tribes to fall in trance in their rites, and on top of that you’ve guitars howling incredible solos.\nThe journey continues with “Silvercomb”. The song starts with some sludgy feedback and fuzzy distorted guitars and bass. After the clock hits the 1:17 mark, Cristina enters howling the words “Keening…”reinforcing the somber atmosphere of the previous songs. After the first time you listen to it, the song sticks inside your head, a good indicator of why the band chooses it as the first single of the album.\nThis debut comes to an end with “Slowthorn” and “Haunted”. These two songs include the trademark sound the band has presented in previous tracks: down-tuned sound, repetitive and hypnotic riffs, groovy bass and ethereal vocals. But, a major difference from previous tracks, highlighting and giving them extra punch is the sound of the snare drum: very chunky, fat and powerful. If you’re a fan of Doom Metal, particularly the one that’s somber with references to witchcraft and the occult, this album will be appealing to you.\nReview by Mr Heavyhead https://morefuzz.net/reviews/haunted-selftitled/\n1.  Nightbreed - 0:00\n2.  Watchtower - 8:31\n3.  Silvercomb - 14:17\n4.  Slowthorn - 21:39\n5.

            "description": "Grande Fox - Space Nest (Full Album) Grande Fox is a Heavy Stoner Rock band from Thessaloniki, Greece. They started in 2013 under the name Fox Terrier and soon went into concert action. Some changes in their composition led to a change of their initial name and their first attempts to record their own material.  Having participated in many concerts and festivals, alongside names such as Emerald Sun and Nightstalker, Grande Fox released their first album, ''Space Nest'' in 2016, and an EP ''Kulning'' in 2018.  'Space Nest'' is their debut album. It contains 8 songs of Stoner Rock with space/psychedelic elements.\nThe songs are groovy with heavy fuzz guitars, bass & drums hard as a rock and vocals ''drowned'' in a bottle of Jack. Songs like ''Strange Situation'', ''Route 66' , ''Burned Beard'', ''New Beginning'' are perfect samples of the album.  All the songs have progressive parts with lot of changes from Psychedelic to Heavy Rock elements.  You can hear influences from Alice In Chains, Faith No More, Black Sabbath, Kyuss, Nightstalker and sometimes Pantera.  The album also features beautiful cover art and solid production.\nReview by Steve the Filthy Dog https://www.filthydogsofmetal.com/reviews-1/grande-fox-space-nest\n1.  Strange Situation - 0:00\n2.

The band's style is a blend of 'golden era' progressive rock - with influential names such are Yes, Genesis, Gentle Giant, Soft Machine, HATFIELD & THE NORTH; as well as classic rock/hard rock and prog related names old and new: Led Zeppelin, The Who, David Bowie, T.Rex and Fish.\nIndeed, this is often cited as a mixture of retro prog, kraut rock, hard rock, psych and glam rock - all together it fuses into a unique spleen, often underlined with dystopian themes. In 2007 they were offered to record an album, and their debut 'Rhizome', released for Bluenoise label, saw the light of the day two years later.\n1.  Cascade Inc. - 0:00\n2.  Requiem - 2:11\n3.

            "description": "Seer - Vol. 6 (Full Album) Since 2014 Vacouver’s Seer have been gracing our ears with some pretty exquisite music. In 2019 they released their second full length album simply entitled Vol. 6. For those who are not familiar Seer are a Doom Metal band at the core but they take away from other genres as well. This gives the band an air of progression and a sound all their own. And this sound is supremely infectious and Vol. 6 harnesses that quality in full.  Seer are one of those bands that takes the listener on a journey through music. Weaving stories and wonder through their lyrics and songs. It is quite refreshing to hear a band take their talents and craft something so satisfying.\nOpening track Oath of Exile presents a haunting introduction to this album, eerie chant like vocals ring through giving way into the following track Iron Worth Striking. The bass and riffs are like thunder and lightning that mirror the vocals that go back and forth between clean and harsh. This track is reminiscent of iron through and through, and will take the listener down a path of torment. Seven Stars, Seven Stones charges forward with melodic power and a mix of slower and faster passages. The last few minutes of this song is filled with memorable solos and chuggy riffs that are perfect to headbang to.\nFrost Tulpa is slow at the start but it builds up momentum with a mix of acoustic sections and whispered harsh vocals. But once this track speeds up the listener is met with growls and screams that are monstrous in tandem with sqealing guitars and huge doomy riffs that work perfectly together. It presents a very evocative aura and showcases the bands talent in the instrument and vocal department.  As The Light Fades is a track that held on and did not want to let go. It hooks you in with unwavering progression until the final notes ring. Vol 6. is the perfect representation of the bands overall growth since the beginning. This album deserves to be recognized in every aspect.\nReview by Goat Wizard https://themetalwanderlust.com/2019/02/11/album-review-vol-6-seer/\n1.  Oath Of Exile - 0:00\n2.

            "summary": "Seer - Vol. 6 (Full Album) Since 2014 Vacouver’s Seer have been gracing our ears with some pretty exquisite music. In 2019 they released their second full length album simply entitled Vol. 6. For those who are not familiar Seer are a Doom Metal band at the core but they take away from other genres as well. This gives the band an air of progression and a sound all their own. And this sound is supremely infectious and Vol. 6 harnesses that quality in full.  Seer are one of those bands that takes the listener on a journey through music. Weaving stories and wonder through their lyrics and songs. It is quite refreshing to hear a band take their talents and craft something so satisfying.",

            "description": "Lambda - Space Express (Full EP) Comprising of Tomáš Zimmerman - guitar,  Václav Ruttkay - bass,   Filip Faschingbauer - guitar and Matěj Kräussl - drums, Lambda are from the Czech Republic and deal in a style of music that I suppose could be described as post-stoner, a sound that sits somewhere between the experimental krautrock of Colour Haze and the more guitar orientated psych of Earthless. Blending these two styles together the band have created their own unique sound, a sound which is displayed to  startling effect on this their debut EP \"Space Express\".\nThe bedrock of Lambda's sound is the heavy (but not brutal) rhythms created by the backline of Ruttkay and Kräussl whose sometimes tight hard rock, sometimes loose funky rhythm work lays a solid foundation on which the two guitarists can riff and solo to their hearts content. Faschingbauer and Zimmerman compliment each other perfectly whether it's laying down some funky wah or ripping a dirty fuzzed up riff both guitarists understand their place in the music, duelling but never trying to outdo each other, painting sonic portraits from their six string palettes. \"Murder In The Zen Garden\" is the only non-instrumental on \"Space Express\" and includes a superb vocal from Black Velvet Suicide's David Kaplin and includes the immortal line \"Mother Nature... she created stoner rock\"...... says it all really.\nReview by Frazer Jones http://stonerking1.blogspot.com/2015/07/catch-space-express-with-czech.html\n1.

            "description": "Jesus The Snake - Black Acid, Pink Rain (New Full Album) For those feeling adventurous, Portugal’s Jesus the Snake follow-up their 2017 self-titled EP with the unmitigated warmth of Black Acid, Pink Rain, their live-recorded full-length debut.  Not one piece of the five total on the 49-minute offering is under eight minutes long, and sandwiched between opener “Karma” and the closing title-track are three cuts circa nine that prove no less hypnotic. The beginning of “Floyds I” is so fluid with the interplay of organ and guitar that one almost expects a gentle Portuguese spoken word verse to start, but of course one never does. Instead, Jesus the Snake complement mindful drift with flashes of more weighted or active fare, all the while holding to a central vibe that is peaceful even as “Duna” finds its chill before the halfway point, with no loss of spirit in the process.\nAn evolutionary, creative and marvelous pilgrimage through the deserts of the mind, with barefoot to wavy, silken and amorous dunes, petrified and beheld by the setting sun, and head buried in the dense and intoxicating astral nebulosity. Dwell in the dazzling mysticism that halos the entire temporal body of this album and feel yourself slumbering in a pleasant stage of inertia that will lead you to the longed for reign of the spiritual trance.\nReview from The Obelisk http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/tag/jesus-the-snake/\n1.  Karma - 0:00\n2.  Floyds I - 10:22\n3.  Floyds II - 19:31\n4.  Duna - 28:28\n5.

They are a three-piece from Valencia in Spain: Adrián (guitars, synths), Dela  (bass guitar) Dela and Lucas (drums), and together they take us on a journey through the sonic universe that begins in the 1970s. It’s a wholly instrumental album, the aforementioned ‘Odyssey’ rises out of the speakers like watching the sun rising over a planet from space as there is a moment of shoegaze before the rhythm of this track bangs in and were away on a motorik journey to the stars.\nIf anything ‘Cult of Youth’ ups the ante with it’s high tempo rhythm section and repeato theme that gives the track a real sense of build… you feel like the music in not only becoming more intense but also dense before 2’30” in it ejaculates into  a punk guitar before powering off in search of the cosmic edge. This isn’t space rock… it’s full on rawk.   As everywhere on this album, they blend elements of kraut and other forms of 70s rock music into a blend that feels bang up to date. They bring the album home with ‘Event Horizon’, a large slab of clearly improvised music which is played with such freedom that you just cannot help being drawn into it. Like the rest of the album it just moves along with a sort of natural purpose as if it was a tune that was always meant to be played.\nReview by Simon https://fragmentedflaneur.com/2018/11/27/album-review-here-the-captain-speaking-the-captain-is-dead-s-t/\n1.

            "description": "Sublunar Express - Sublunar Express (New Full Album) Sublunar Express is a Montreal based power trio formed in 2017 by Denis Dufour, Emmanuel Heis and Daniel Paras. Blending genres such as krautrock, stoner, and atmospheric rock, reuniting broad influences: an always moving psychedelic locomotive.  The moonlight reveals a train that travels only in the darkness. Simultaneously moving through endless space and bottomless depths, the sound of a thunderous engine disturbs the chilling solitude, and the strange creatures once lurking in obscurity.\nEponymous debut album, a dose of dark psychedelia mixed with krautrock and post-rock influences. Backed by a relentless rhythm section, guitar lines soar and forge a dream-like atmosphere while maintaining a vibrant roar.  The artwork is a perfect representation of what you will get here : an insistent rhythm section that always moves forward like a steam locomotive through a sea of psychedelic and immersive textures. A beautiful blend of genres with great versatility and great playing.\n1.  Jet Lag - 0:00\n2.  New Moon - 3:33\n3.  Electric Sea - 16:15\n4.  Splinter - 19:11\n5.

            "description": "Chang - Superlocomotodrive (New Full EP) Chang is a German garage and fuzz rock band. Founded in 2019, Chang released their first EP \"Superlocomotodrive\" in January 2020.  Munich-based trio Chang, with clear, modern production behind them, present their debut EP release with the 29-minute Superlocomotodrive, and though it’s short, one is left wondering what else they might need to consider it an album. What’s missing?\nYou’ve got the let’s-jam-outta-here in the six-minute opener and longest track  “Mescalin,” and plenty of gruff riffing to back that up in “Old Rusty Car” and the later title-track, with a bit of Oliveri-era Queens of the Stone Age edge in the latter to boot, plus some psychedelic lead work in “Sterne,” some particularly German quirk in “Bottle Beach” and a massive buildup in tension in the finale “Bombs Whisper” that seems to arrive at its moment of payoff only to instead cut to silence and purposefully leave the listener hanging — an especially bold move for a first release. Yeah, it’s under half an hour long, but so what? The heavy rock terrain Chang are working in is familiar enough — but there’s no sense that Superlocomotodrive wants to be something it isn’t. It’s heavy rock celebrating heavy rock.\nReview from The Obelisk http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/tag/chang-superlocomotodrive/\n1.  Mescalin - 0:00\n2.  Old Rusty Car - 6:34\n3.

Anatomy of Abuses is the first album by Serpent Cobra. It's songs were created during 2017-2019. Serpent Cobra is the malevolent creation of Carolina Dussau (a.k.a fleshripper), the lead singer and bass, and Emanuel Acosta (a.k.a brainblaster), the lead guitar. The album is full of nasty riffs and its lyrics are about trespassing the lines of the forbidden; lust, degradation to the lowest of carnal desires, adultery, and the inevitability of punishment, the ultimate consequence for uncontrollable sin.\n1.

It's songs were created during 2017-2019. Serpent Cobra is the malevolent creation of Carolina Dussau (a.k.a fleshripper), the lead singer and bass, and Emanuel Acosta (a.k.a brainblaster), the lead guitar. The album is full of nasty riffs and its lyrics are about trespassing the lines of the forbidden; lust, degradation to the lowest of carnal desires, adultery, and the inevitability of punishment, the ultimate consequence for uncontrollable sin.",

            "summary": "Marv - l & ll (Full Album)  Marv's first two EP's combined into one full length video.  Marv was forged in the basement of a bowling alley for the sole purpose of creating loud, heavy, progressive rock music. With the corpses of 1000 guitar pedals at their feet, Marv built a wall of amplifiers to defend themselves from the rolling thunder that was constantly crashing above their heads. Marv has an unreasonably large record collection. Marv sold his car to buy a synthesizer. Marv stays in on Friday nights to learn King Crimson songs. Listen to MARV",

            "description": "Mr Bison - Holy Oak (Full Album) The number of dudes in Mr. Bison? Three. The number of those same dudes named Matteo? Three. The number album their new one, Holy Oak is in their discography? Three. The number of bassists who appear on that same record? None. Number of times you’re going to be responsible for knowing these numbers? Zero, because by the time the Pisa-based sans-bass three-piece of guitarist/vocalists Matteo Barsacchi, Matteo Sciocchetto and drummer/vocalist Matteo D’Ignazi are about two songs in — to the total nine; because numbers — the sweet fuzz, classic style fuzz and periodic excursions into psychedelic space are going to melt the math away anyhow.\nMr. Bison, who release Holy Oak as their second offering through Subsound Records behind 2016’s Asteroid, hone in on the pivotal spirit of modern desert rock. There’s some element of push in songs like “Heavy Rain,” but they’re just as likely to spend their time spreading out an open atmosphere.  Their third album is mature and aware of the moves it’s making between louder, more driving material and its more subdued places, and the Matteos effectively play different sides off each other both within songs — the 7:30 centerpiece title-track walks by and waves — and in the transition between them as well.\nLike many acts who operate without a bass, their claim is that the guitar tones make up for it. And true enough, any band can tune lower to make up for the lacking thicker strings if they’re so inclined, but to think of the legacy of great heavy rock loadbearers — from Geezer Butler through Scott Reeder and so on — and it would seem to be not even so much the tone as the dynamic they’re denying themselves. They compensate by weaving different guitar parts in and around each other, and in so doing craft something that, admittedly, is more their own than it would be if they were a simple guitar/bass/drum configuration. Some of it is a familiar lead/rhythm dynamic, but “The Bark” operates tonally like a battle of dueling Hendrixes, and the results make for a legitimately exciting listen.\nFrom the mid-paced groove of opener “Roots” and the blown-out shuffle swagger of “Sacred Deal” — there may not be any bass, but I’d swear I hear an organ — onward, Mr. Bison retain fervent control over their transitions and the fluidity of Holy Oak as a whole. At 46 minutes, it does not feel like a minor undertaking, but neither is it redundant, as “Heavy Rain” breathes ambient life into the initial salvo and “Earth Breath” contrasts with more straightforward edge and riffing.  In the post-Black Rainbows sphere of Italian heavy, Mr. Bison make a place for themselves alongside acts like Tuna de Tierra, who take the established tenets of various forms of heavy and pull them together in varying balances in order to best serve their songwriting.\nReview from The Obelisk http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2018/05/18/mr-bison-holy-oak-review-stream/\n1.

            "description": "Cardinals Folly - Defying The Righteous Way (New Full Album) Finnish psychotic heavy Doom Metal cult- originally formed as The Coven back in 2004, laughing at stoner/retro trends as Cardinals Folly since 2007. Defying The Righteous Way is the fifth studio album of Helsinki's deranged pagan sons, bringing more psychotic doom with punk and black metal influences. After their critically acclaimed last album ‘Deranged Pagan Sons’ the band has now collected seven new songs that bring you Doom Metal with occult and obscure lyrics, performed with Punk’s rawness, Black Metal’s harshness and tasty riffs that harken back to the glory days of Heavy Metal.\nThe first track, Stars Align Again can trudge and meander with the best of them, but then it gallops into battle via a tempo shift, with nary a drop of sweat shed.  And then the wailing vocals mutate into a full-on black metal shriek, before it slows back down again with skilled ease. It’s urgent, direct, catchy and, yes, rather glorious. The album’s sound safely established, Cardinals Folly goes forth to use it time and again to murder the listener. As tracks like Deranging The Priest, Ultra-Violence and Last House On The Left show, the lurch from rage to misery and back again is a winning formula.  The despair and bleakness sits well with the shrieking and wrath. It’s melancholy you can punch faces to. And it works, time and again.

Defying The Righteous Way is the fifth studio album of Helsinki's deranged pagan sons, bringing more psychotic doom with punk and black metal influences. After their critically acclaimed last album ‘Deranged Pagan Sons’ the band has now collected seven new songs that bring you Doom Metal with occult and obscure lyrics, performed with Punk’s rawness, Black Metal’s harshness and tasty riffs that harken back to the glory days of Heavy Metal.",

            "description": "Dirty Grave - Sin After Death (New Full Album) Dirty Grave plough a well trodden musical trough through the fetid soils of what is known as proto-doom, the Brazilian quartet borrow elements from such bastions of the proto-doom genre as Black Sabbath and Pentagram yet somehow manage to a create sound and groove that is totally unique and utterly their own. This uniqueness owes much to the distinctive vocal stylings of bassist/vocalist Mark Rainbow.\nRainbow sneers, growls, screams, groans and croons his way through the eight songs that make up \"Sin After Death\", his varied vocal inflections bringing an air of malice and sinisterness to the table that both Ozzy (Osborne) and Bobby (Liebling) would find hard to compete with. Rainbow also plays a mean bass and his growling bottom end, combined with Henrique Lima's tight powerhouse percussion, lays the perfect foundation for guitarists Pedro Barros and Victor Berg to showcase their prowess with a stunning array of raunchy doomic refrains and scorching metallic solos, the two six-stringers playing over, around and off each other in a masterclass of how to combine schooled technical ability with raw natural feel.\nA band can be accomplished musicians but if that band does not have the songs to best frame those abilities... well its game over. Thankfully Dirty Grave do not only have the musical chops they also have the songs, dark proto flavoured rockers like \"In This Night\" and \"Turn Off All My Fears\", theatrical laced doomic tomes with schizophrenic vocal melodies like \"Slaughter (Human Race Is Dead)\" and \"Satan's Wings II (I Saw The Devil)\" and blues tinted stoner metal such as \"Slow Journey\", in fact there is not one single song on \"Sin After Death\" that falls into the realms of mediocre or banal, each track an essential part of the whole.\nReview by Frazer Jones http://stonerking1.blogspot.com/2019/12/dirty-grave-sin-after-death-review.html\n1.

RIS combines a wide spectrum of musical influences from ambient/mellow to groovy/aggressive hooks including many genres like metal/rock/folk/progressive/groove creating a musical landscape like no other. 'Kitro', the bands 3rd release is a breath of fresh air. It’s edgy, it’s funky as hell, it has a Latin feel to it.\nLead single Therion exemplifies the tone of the 12 songs included on Kitro, steeped primarily in the Greek folk scene, classic rock and a sprinkling of punk gang vocals with a pace to match. Mix a Flying V and an oud and this is what you get: modern metal mixed with the traditional.  Kitro sounds inspired by its surroundings, the manic energy of the Greek roads, the volatility of its streets, and pride in the band’s homeland.\nReview by  Craig Huntley https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/raw-in-sect-kitro-album-review\n1.

            "description": "Formula 400 - Heathens (New Full Album) Heathens is the debut album by Californian Fuzz/Stoner Rockers – Formula 400\" – and it’s an album packed full of streetwise attitude with the band focusing on old-school exciting Stoner Rock sounds with a heavy FUZZ based atmosphere.  Opener Light My Way pulls no punches with it’s hard edge lyrics and it’s dirty Desert/Fuzz/Stoner Rock riffs with an almost aggressive edge to it all. Though, the song is still a proper groove-orientated number which allows the band plenty of opportunity to play some epic guitar riffs with the FUZZ rock vibe leading the way.\nMessenger carries on the harsh FUZZ vibe with a distorted voice setting the scene before Formula 400 come bursting in with a heavy and meaty riffs that is full of instant hooks and carries on the Outlaw Way Of Life depicted on the album cover. The song has a 90s Stoner Rock/Metal influence and Formula 400 run away with this style of music for one of the most straight-forward and standout songs on the album.  If you’re looking for an album that offers a quick and mightily heavy fix of Stoner Rock/Metal tunes with an unapologetic attitude then Heathens is the place to be. This is a superbly made album that all Stoner Rock/Metal fans should check out.\nReview by Steve Howe https://outlawsofthesun.blogspot.com/2020/06/formula-400-heathens-album-review.html\n1.

Midnight Coven are back with a delicious new full length titled \"Ignite\". Just in time for all of you creepy creepers craving that spooky new sound. Aaron Baker delivers yet again with this unique and strangely heavy album. Imagine an 80's horror film or a science fiction creation from the 1970's. This album is very different than \"Bewitched\", more stripped with intricate drum patterns and a more refined sound. A necessary soundtrack for your late night drive through the forest. Through the fog, the creatures eyes glimmer in the darkness.",

            "description": "Fatima - Turkish Delights (New Full Album) This is some extremely fuzzy stoner doom. This French band just released 'Turkish Delights', eight tracks of psychedelic fuzz and doom. Some excellent stuff in this, a blast to listen to. Their new album ‘Turkish Delights’ was released April 10th and is occult rock of the highest order. A band with so many influences in their sound, you can hear grunge and psych, punk and doom and there are few bands that succeed in getting such a varied sound. Tune in now.\nFor those who think that grunge died in the last century and is no longer their concern, trust it to a power trio to make it clear that there’s life in the downcast beast yet. Generally the remit of the vocals and rolling patter of the drums, moments of ‘90s nostalgia come into bloom through drawling choruses and blurry riffing, distortion dragged through the mud like trailing jeans unravelling into frayed tails. No idiotic feedback odysseys adjoin these moments of pure nirvana, however; a bucking, overdriven bass keeps the songs concise and meaningful even with the sticky potential of peeling off into a Turkish jam, during which the Eastern tendencies perfume the air with tangy sharp strings and wafting melodies. So, that’s your grunge and stoner bits, which are more or less what keep Turkish Delights in rock territories, though the heft of a few riffs in 'Hyena' and the bass-heavy 'Toy Poodle' pushes the sound towards doom as well.\nFatima spares us from the usual straight-faced tendencies of their chosen genres by imbuing the whole record with a lithe sense of energy, powering through 35 minutes as if it’s nothing. The samples also weigh heavily in the equation. Starting 'Saliva Bath' with the snappy line “Ah, little sweet one with your heart of gold, I know the place where we can be alone to join our souls in sacred truth” makes one look rather differently at its thick grooves and gritty high-range vocals, while the eerie slower mid-section and crushingly heavy ending call to mind Mammoth Weed Wizard Bastard due to the haunting electronics in the background. Equally, the sarcastic repetition of “a complete and hopeless nerd” proves a witty foil for the propulsive stoner grunge of 'Concubines of Salem'. It definitely helps that the whole song sounds like a distantly remembered chorus from 1993.\nIn essence, the kookiness of Turkish Delights becomes its greatest joy, since Fatima’s presentation of these 8 cuts revels in digressions and references that linger for a moment and then disappear. The album comes to revolve around the excellent 'Gooey Syrup', coming on like The Cure circa Faith and adding the twangs of Eastern strings to propel a foundational quiet/loud dynamic, culminating in a chorus that you’ll sing without knowing the words and a lead section that you’ll scream along to without knowing where it’s going. The whole experience rises and falls like mid-period Deftones albums, not because Fatima sound similar but because aggression and hooks are flipped round and become an enticing journey of uncertainty.  Fatima play weird, anonymous, hip-shaking stoner grunge doom jams, but the French trio’s inventiveness and attitude are totally endearing.\nReview by Edmund Morton http://www.metal-observer.com/3.o/review/fatima-turkish-delights/\n1.

            "description": "Sautrus - Anthony Hill (Full Album) Sautrus is a heavy tuned psychedelic/stoner band from Northern Poland formed in 2010.  Sautrus describe themselves as a ‘heavily tuned psych-rock band skillfully combining elements of 60’s rock with contemporary metal creating a completely mind blowing sound’. Bringing everything to the table and then some is how I read that and believe me, they have done just that with this latest offering. From harmonica to throat-singing, they have not left a lot out of the frying pan here and each flavor adds to each of the seven tracks served up and you can tell from the outset that this is not some new group of guys trying to find their way, but are indeed seasoned musicians that have spent their time honing their identity.\nForty one minutes in length, opener ‘The Way’ sets a great pace for this album with so many different segments strung seamlessly together for the entire seven minutes plus. ‘Good Mourning’ starts with a smoky blues harp intro before the rest of the band kicks in and punches you right in the chest with one of those tempos that pulls you along like a train and you can’t help but reach out and turn up to ‘still not loud enough’!! That harmonica keeps it’s hold on your head as the band shows a solidity of form that had been hinted at with previous tracks but not realized until this album. ‘The Fungus’ comes right out with a jazz-swing tempo that makes you sway until the Sabbath sounding body of the song really begins and you can almost taste the smoke in the air as the bass rumbles your walls throughout this stoner/sludge epic feeds the need for exactly this, something so solid and dripping in the energy of pure music.\nIt fades off to the pure psych ‘Cats On The Fence’ that drips of a HANS KERSHI style vocal amid the loopy science-fiction frequency bounces showing yet another side that we may not have exactly expected but have to smile with none the less. ‘Synopticon’ wastes zero time in stepping up as a pummeler with a driving run up and down the necks of the stringed instruments and multi-layered vocals swirling as so many embers glowing in their combined dance through the air surrounding you, even as each step follows this tale unfolding with the passion pushed into this tortured mic “To survive, survive…” The break at 5 minutes is right on time, letting you grab a deep breathe as the guitars scream to and against each other until the cymbal run picks it back up to resume the run to the end, staying up front to catch each note and word given.\n‘Shotgun’ is the perfect shifting of gears and right away, you are moving along. Complex and savory, the flavor is dark and heavy as you can want it and when that vocal hits, full forward is the only way to travel alongside. Closer ‘When The War Is Over’ is amazing in it’s acoustic simplicity after the previous six tracks, each showing a complexity of their own. Perfect cap on an amazing release. BUY it the second you can get it and support them if you are lucky enough to have them in your area!\nReview by http://tastenationllc.com/sautrus-anthony-hill-album-review-video-feature/\n1.

            "description": "Red Swamp - Desertdrive (Full Album) Hungarian stoner-sludge metal bandits Red Swamp might be familiar to anyone keeping a keen eye on the eastern European underground scene, their recent second LP, titled “Desertdrive” was released in 2018.  Beginning the sludgy proceedings with plenty of energy, it’s no surprise that Waste was chosen as the first single of the album. With buckets of stoner groove, the fuzziness that is often associated with the sub-genre is far cleaner here allowing the vocals to really shine. An easy track to enjoy.\nCrossed brings a harder beat as the drums crash, the riffs get right down and dirty and the vocals even roar with metal venom. Quite a contrast between the first two tracks showing off Red Swamps versatility. That continues into the title track as hot & arid air blows over you. The Emptiest keeps the quality rhythm trucking along nicely. Before Leech and Castaways provide mammoth sized chunks of heavy stoner groove with surprisingly harsh moments of heaviness and soaring vocals. The former has a nice bit of sleaze. While the latter attempts to make you vomit up your last meal with stomach churning hooks and black metal style gurgles!\nIt’s a crime that Red Swamp’s Desertdrive is only 8 tracks long. Each one is a force to be reckoned with and different enough to stand out individually. If there is any particular track that is lacking the same oomph, it is Rediscover and only because the vocals don’t wow in quite the same way. Certainly don’t want to do it a disservice though as the guitars pick up the slack nicely! This excellent release closes out with one final high-tempo track that brings a punk rock snarl and surrounds that with so many strong riffs. Queen of the Dirt leaves many in the dust with its heavy rock rhythm. Desertdrive can proudly hold its sunburnt and thirsty head up high.\nReview by Carl Fisher https://www.gbhbl.com/album-review-red-swamp-desertdrive-hunnia-records/\n1.  Waste - 0:00\n2.

Louder, fuzzier and trippier than ever.  After 3 long years the boys are back with the follow up to Legalize It.  Zeroin features 8 new riff rides plus a couple remixes of Colour Blind. This is kinda stoner rock's answer to three chord punk - it is so simple, yet so satisfying. The guitars are warm and heavy. This album is a smoking green hymn for every fuzz-addicted stoner-doom-enthusiast, seeking for a warm and welcoming, but powerful and ass-kicking, ocean of musically baked joy, to get lost in.  I'm not great at discerning the subtle messages, but I THINK they might be into the marijuana.\n1.  Go Away - 0:00\n2.  Zeroin - 4:42\n3.  Back To Zero - 7:56\n4.

Louder, fuzzier and trippier than ever.  After 3 long years the boys are back with the follow up to Legalize It.  Zeroin features 8 new riff rides plus a couple remixes of Colour Blind. This is kinda stoner rock's answer to three chord punk - it is so simple, yet so satisfying. The guitars are warm and heavy.

The band captures a blend of classic 70’s and modern psych. They create epic compositions which include a vibrant mix of motoric, drone, blues, oriental, dub, post rock, metal and classic rock. Their music is instrumentally based, laden with heavy amounts of psychedelia and space rock, both of which resonate with enticing garnishes that one could attribute to krautrock. It is served in a most fluid state, chilled but with just the right amount of blues in an almost improve-like sonic decanter.  The Second Coming is their new sophomore full length album, the follow up to 2018's Hormonizer.\n1.  Departure (intro) - 0:00\n2.  Retrograde Delux - 3:16\n3.  Crimson Master - 15:17\n4.

The band mixes elements of post-rock and post-metal with a Doom laden atmosphere.  Their debut album 'Guadalupe Cartel' is composed of ambient songs that try to evoke a special atmosphere during the listening. Each song is like traveling to a different planet, some are smaller, some have stronger gravity.",

            "description": "Slap Guru - Umashi's Odyssey (New Full Album) Since 2015 Slap Guru has been rocking in Madrid mixing blues, doom, prog and stoner rock.  The four piece have released their third full-length album 'Umashi's Odyssey', and it's more than worth the wait. Mixing 70's hard rock, stoner crunch, and proggy eastern melodies, the band's latest is a far-reaching concept album based on the novel of the same name and covers a wide array of sounds. The diversity of influences at play is made immediately apparent in the first two tracks, as the strings and pastoral vibes of opener \"Meeting the Mermaids\" are followed up by the retro stop-start shuffle of \"Acid One\". A piercing lick serves as the track's cornerstone, and each of its quick bursts leaves you eagerly waiting for the next.\nThe rest of the LP continues the pattern of alternating speed and style, such as the excellent contrast between the mid-tempo southern swagger of \"The Night With Its Spells\" and the high energy rush of \"Erkil\", whose psyched out solo is an album highlight. The best is saved for last, however, with closer \"The Plastic Island\". Warm bass pulses along with sunny, bouncing guitar before the track launches into a show-stopping riff, hammering out a warbling eastern melody in a sharp attack that demands repeat listens. Umashi's Odyssey is an epic effort by Slap Guru, loaded with memorable hooks, talent to spare, and a style that traverses influences with ease, making for an adventure not to be missed.\nReview by Shasta Beast https://stonerhive.blogspot.com/2020/04/slap-guru-umashis-odyssey.html\n1.

            "description": "Kayleth - 2020 Back to Earth (New Full Album) After years of traveling through space looking for new worlds, on May 8th Italian stoner rockers Kayleth returned to their home planet with the hotly anticipated release of their third full-length album, titled \"2020 Back to Earth\", via their mothership Argonauta Records. While each of the band's records tell a story, this time Kayleth find the earth in a disastrous condition, a planet mutilated by its humans. But Kayleth won't give up. The wish to understand how life works and express it through music is a springboard to change the world with their sound. And this is a heavy dose of the Doom, Psychedelic and Stoner hailing of the realms of Space Rock.\nOpener Corrupted swoops with sci-fi electronic, a robotic voice instructing “Let’s rock!” before big crunchy riffs open the throttle into an easy stoner drive. Dazzling, effects drenched solos launch as swinging bass and drum rhythms try to keep things grounded, forcing winding left and right turns of clattering, carefree rock’n’roll. Concrete‘s descending drums and fat chords live up to the title, scuzzy bass grooves and a spattering of prog easing things into a breathless, racing drive.\nLost In The Canyons stabs with heavy bass and stomping grooves before giving way to dizzying fretwork. Just when the track seems like a stoner rock checkbox exercise, bombastic sax work breathes welcome new life. The Dawn Of Resurrection slowly builds to a zenith of more spaced out soloing, Delta Pavonis flattening out as the desert landscape stretches out, buoyed by dunes of low down boogie and grumbling bass.\nBy Your Side bounces around before settling into another cruise around a focal point of snare. Electron pulses and throbs with gristly, droning synths before loping along with a swinging riff. The Avalanche pulses with kicks and B-movie sound effects, closing on a lumbering riff. Sirens is all moody bass and breathy vocals, creeping guitars whining away over distant toms that beat slowly and deliberately. It’s the most foreboding and minor-key track on the record, sticking out because of it. Closer Cosmic Thunder morphs from a buzzsaw synth wave into rhythmic grooves, a foot-stomper throughout, nailing the requisite good-time stoner rock vibes and running with them to a climactic end.\nReview by Jay Hampshire https://distortedsoundmag.com/album-review-2020-back-to-earth-kayleth/\n1.

While each of the band's records tell a story, this time Kayleth find the earth in a disastrous condition, a planet mutilated by its humans. But Kayleth won't give up. The wish to understand how life works and express it through music is a springboard to change the world with their sound. And this is a heavy dose of the Doom, Psychedelic and Stoner hailing of the realms of Space Rock.",

Warning, an over-use of sea-faring metaphors awaits ye! These Greek instrumentalists navigate stoner rock’s choppier waters….but with a 70’s prog twist! After setting sail it’s not long before calmer oceans are navigated and Hazy Sea‘s prog intentions wash over you; culminating in a swathe of beautiful, calming excursions into the most mesmerising guitar playing imaginable.\nTo call Cargo Incognito background music sounds derogatory but these laid-back paeans to 70’s guitar gods such as Clapton and Gilmour are the perfect accompaniment to whatever you may be doing.  Restrained, mellow and technically brilliant throughout, these 7 tracks seep into your consciousness by the sheer warming nature of their sound and with more than a little Pink Floyd (and particularly David Gilmour’s solo work) informing the core of their music, Hazy Sea are awash with nostalgia, harking back to the days of mind-altering experimentation and honest-to-goodness musicianship.\n1.

            "description": "Hex A.D. - Astro Tongue in the Electric Garden (New Full Album) Norway’s Hex A.D. are back, a mere sixteen months or so since they last enchanted us with the Netherworld Triumphant album; in truth, not much has changed in camp Hex sonically since then. However, that’s a plus point as the band, eschewing the chance to throw the baby out with the prog metal bathwater, have merely honed their skills and sharpened their metaphorical axes, in the process refining what went before into something possibly even more dangerous, and certainly just as alluring.\nOverall, the feel on Astro Tongue in the Electric Garden is a tad more in your face. Riffs that threatened assault and battery of the ears last time around actually carry the deed out this time, and even the Hammond work of Mags Johansen is somehow more menacing. The glowering interplay of Johansen and guitarist Rick Hagen on The Day The Sky Exploded is a soaring, yet resolutely earthbound piece of doom brilliance, the instruments combining to spread dread and fear wherever they might be heard. It’s this relationship between Johansen and Hagen that underpins and defines the H A.D. sound, and the adamantine sheets of sound they throw up on every song create soundscapes that aren’t easily forgotten despite the overall lack of what an untrained ear might call ‘hookiness’.\nThat said, the titanic pairing of Hawks & Doves and Old Bones, two movements in what the band calls The Monsoon Suite, are as good if not better than anything the band has committed to tape yet. The first is a lurching, riff-driven blues that re-animates the first Black Sabbath album as seen through a prism of latter day names like Wilson and Akerfeldt; the second is a little more melodic, and happy to dwell in the Dio/Rainbow shadowlands of classic rifferama and swirling keyboard interplay. As a pair the songs represent everything that makes Hex A.D. such an interesting prospect for a listener.\nAstro Tongue… is an album to immerse yourself in; a record that warrants time on the part of the listener to fully appreciate what’s going on. A darkened room, maybe, some top-notch headphones and a bottle of good red to help the appreciation process along… lose yourself in the filigree timelessness of A Stone For The Bodies Not Found, and emerge all the better and more fulfilled for the experience. The new Gods of prog metal? It’s a big claim to make on a band’s behalf, but on the evidence of this album, it might just be the right one.\nReview by Scott Adams https://www.sentineldaily.com.au/hex-a-d-astro-tongue-in-the-electric-garden-fresh-tea/\n1.

            "description": "Satyrus - Rites (New Full Album) Since their formation back in 2016, Italy’s Satyrus have been incredibly quiet on the recording front, opting to play live and build a solid following. Satyurs venerate a classic doom sound, without straying into the territory of being an outright carbon copy of other, more well established acts. Their long awaited debut album, Rites, is a really good start for the band, and sees them take a brilliant musical base and begin to, tentatively, impress their own style onto it, making for a dark and atmospheric album.\nBlack Satyrus with its sonorous, chanted vocals, sets a dark and atmospheric tone for Rites. The main part of this track is comprised of sludgy, slightly psychedelic guitar hooks and soaring vocals, with solid drumming providing a great, hypnotic rhythm to the whole song. This is a powerful and beguiling way to kick the album off, blending the darker aspects of doom with an infectious, catchy groove, setting a lofty bar for the rest of the record to overcome. Shovel once again uses great, cinematic elements to draw the listener in, before a dense, crushing guitar starts the proceedings. It’s got a far more caustic and monstrous sound than the previous offering, with juggernaut rhythmic moments providing a great contrast for the slick lead riffs that punctuate the music.\nSwirl makes great use of harsher tones and monolithic motifs to craft one of the more intense offerings on the album. Huge guitar chords and thunderous drumming give this song an excellent backdrop, with some glorious vocals carving through the mix and adding a dramatic exclamation to an already dramatic and interesting piece of music. It’s a brilliant exercise in mixing great music with an equally amazing atmosphere, resulting in one of the albums stand out tracks. Stigma, with its impenetrable fuzz and tar thick bass, is another notable apex for this album, taking the music much deeper into a stoner sound than any of the tracks that came before it. There’s also some incredibly adventurous guitar playing that really carries the track at many points, and some far more experimental moments than many of the albums earlier offerings, making this a brilliant and varied track from start to finish.\nTrailblazer is a haunting and morose slow burner, and gradually gathers pace as it progresses. This track sees some of the best use of the bass, with meaty, overpowering hooks giving this song the focal point around which the rest of the music is built. The guitars have a lighter, more ethereal approach, and the vocals really add an epic edge to this hazy and murky piece of music. It’s an eclectic and memorable way to close a fantastic album.\nRites isn’t trying to reinvent the wheel when it comes to doom metal, but this is nonetheless a great experience with a lot of strong music to offer. The use of soundbites and the slight experimentation with tone help to really elevate this album at many points, turning great, epic music into heavily atmospheric and engrossing monoliths. It’s hard to find fault with the music itself; tight, groove-laden and powerful, it brings together all the various of ingredients that go into making brilliant doom. Rites is a great debut record.\nReview by Danny Sanderson https://distortedsoundmag.com/album-reivew-rites-satyrus/\n1.  Black Satyrus - 0:00\n2.  Shovel - 11:41\n3.  Swirl - 19:26\n4.

Starting out as a duo and growing into a five- piece crew, they blend psychedelic, garage, desert rock and shoegaze aesthetics to generate a sonic amalgam that fills up your mind after a listen.\nThe debut album, 'Out Of The Sun', is a 30-minute orgazmic flirt with the best of modern Californian surfy psychedelia, shoegaze and laid-back stoner rock, with quite enough guitar noise experiments that sound homogeneous and smartly interpreted without crossing the slight border with the chaotic and messed up noise. Channeling the spirits of The Doors, The Moby Grape and The Animals, Comasummer deliver an impressive album of psych filled songs that sound undeniably cool... A top notch debut that leaves you wanting more.\n1.  Out of the Sun - 0:00\n2.  My Vantage Point - 4:52\n3.  Rental Kisses - 10:34\n4.  Hurricane Love - 14:34\n5.  Man in the Sand - 21:00\n6.

Influenced by bands ranging from Deep Purple to Unsane through Black Sabbath and Kyuss, ÖfÖ AM has chosen to remain instrumental and focus each of its pieces around a central theme. Hidden in the shadows, ÖfÖ AM has furbished its tentacles, sharpened its aerial and indomitable stoner. Since their beginning in 2009, the band has released an Ep, an Album and 2 splits (including one with Karma To Burn) and has played all across Europe.\nIn \"Tales From Outerspace: An Octaman's Odyssey.\" ÖfÖ AM invites you to travel in an imaginary film: Octaman, a sprawling hero of modern times who will cross deserts and tribal landscapes and get lost in the narrow and stinking streets of intergalactic megacities, he will settle his accounts in spaceships and save his species from extinction in epic battles .... ÖfÖ Am is back and it's going to rock! This record is solid 70's 80's hard rock and metal. VERY tuneful and never too heavy. What's amazing is that OfO AM actually manage to make this music sound like a soundtrack in heavy rock form.\n1.  Bamakö - 0:00\n2.  Gergövie - 4:50\n3.  Eddy's Funeral - 9:34\n4.

Influenced by bands ranging from Deep Purple to Unsane through Black Sabbath and Kyuss, ÖfÖ AM has chosen to remain instrumental and focus each of its pieces around a central theme. Hidden in the shadows, ÖfÖ AM has furbished its tentacles, sharpened its aerial and indomitable stoner. Since their beginning in 2009, the band has released an Ep, an Album and 2 splits (including one with Karma To Burn) and has played all across Europe.",

            "description": "Sex Blender - Hormonizer (Full Album) What an extraordinary debut album from the Ukrainian Sex Blender. “Hormonizer” fascinatingly blends psychedelic rock with blues and stoner rock, carefully driven by a krautrock atmosphere, even with space for some drone inputs.  Their music is instrumentally based, laden with heavy amounts of psychedelia and space rock, both of which resonate with enticing garnishes that one could attribute to krautrock. It is served in a most fluid state, chilled but with just the right amount of blues in an almost improv-like sonic decanter.\n“Pterozister” is the perfect place for the guys to stretch their musical muscles. They do exactly that in a variety of aural exercises, but first the song teeters within a very minimalist, stripped down state at its start. Atmospherically heady and immensely hypnotic, you feel as if you’re being pulled into the cosmic infinite right from the get-go.\n“Das Morotik” is the album’s shortest song, landing just a bit shy of six minutes… but what an almost six minutes it is! Uptempo and chock full of energized groove propelling it, the track is a fine example of the more jammy side of Sex Blender‘s nature. These tripped-out Ukrainians have put sex in a blender, and it sounds way less painful than you’d imagine. In fact, it’s super cool and colourful.\nReview by Pat Whitaker https://www.riffrelevant.com/2018/05/12/sex-blender-hormonizer-review-stream-fest-2018/\n1.  Das Motorik - 0:00\n2.  Diver - 5:46\n3.

The first full length ‘Purifire’ was released on June 21st 2019. Here Sonum X unites the most lysergic stoner heritage, a few touches of alternative rock and a remarkable inventiveness in a work that in its derivative being shows personality and a sincere love for music. Their \"Intro\" combines almost electronic minimalism and a pseudo-western taste, and is able to immediately evoke the desert outside Palm Springs to which the Sonum X clearly look with love; but already the following title track rises in search of a successful synthesis with more psychedelic and at the same time scratchy components. Also on other occasions, there are highly effective lysergic peaks: F\nFor example in “T. Ripper X \", where the excellent technical skills of the band also emerge, or on\" Spectrum \", with its filtered singing, and in general it hits the expressive freedom of the band. The songs are sometimes cloaked in a melodic gloom, the rhythms are definitely less syncopated, but there is something equally suffered in singing. On “Manhattan” there is also an unpublished saxophone, but the most granitic component is not abandoned, thanks to the ability to insert in every song riffs that have their roots in hard rock and in the most crystalline heavy metal, however veered towards the stoner world: As in \"Psychotemple\", whose Sabbathian roots are powerful.\nInitially delicate, but extremely abrasive, \"Fading Flowers\" throws us in the freer nineties, halfway between Seattle and the Rancho de la Luna, while the acidic \"Days Of Wolves\", in which the gloomy riff and hallucinated vocal line almost suggest Pentagram.  Musically there is something for all tastes, without pimping and with great ideas.\nReview by Simone Vavalà https://metalitalia.com/album/sonum-x-purifire/\n1.  Intro - 0:00\n2.  Purifire - 1:42\n3.

            "description": "Census Of Hallucinations - Census Of Hallucinations (Full Album) Census Of Hallucinations have been around since the turn of the millennium. They are much loved and highly respected purveyors of psychedelic spacerock with cool grooves, tentative weirdness and a well crafted approach to making music that expands the mind and stirs the soul.  Perhaps the most cosmic project yet from the multi-faceted folks at Stone Premonitions . The lineup includes Terri~B on vocals, sampling and programming, Tim Jones on vocals, guitars and keyboards, Steve Ellis on keyboards, Rabbit on bass, and Norm Emerson on drums. They are joined by Kingsley Burn on bass, Dave Pipkin on drums and percussion, Michael Steadman on sax and flute, and Hardy is present with his trusty bomber.\nThere's a great deal of variety across the 16 tracks on this self titled debut from 2000. Music to caress your mind and take you to beautiful otherworldly places, cosmic psychedelia, and, of course, songs... Tim and Terri canNOT resist a good song. And they're intimate with the mechanics of recording, which means there's a good bit of studio fun that either transitions between songs or make up the songs themselves. Tracks like \"Integration\", \"Flying Humanoids\", and \"Holographic Theory\" feature floating melodic psychedelia consisting of guitars, synths, and gorgeous textured backgrounds. A faint buzzsaw drone on \"Integration\" produces a hypnotic effect. Close your eyes and float away.\nThe more song-oriented tracks on the set feature the trademark SP songwriting craftsmanship, but incorporates just enough space electronica to give the tunes their cosmic edge. \"The Moon\" and \"Orion\" are my favorites of the songs. These folks can sing a great acoustic song and still make it mucho spacey. Freaky synths and tablas on \"The Moon\" embellish things nicely. And \"Window Of Opportunity\" is the album's great groove track, much like a Rabbit's Hat tune. Bluesy guitar, sax, a bit of a jazzy pop edge, but then you've got those freaky whooshing synths keeping everything in space.\n\"Lizard Man\" and \"The Big Pink Jam Sandwich\" are the album's main cosmic freakout tracks. \"Lizard Man\" is one moment floating, the next searing acidic psychedelia. Mix in lots of chanting and wild synth patterns and you get a wonderfully chaotic mindfuck track. Truly feel-good jamming guitar too. And for \"The Big Pink Jam Sandwich\"... fasten your seatbelts, close your eyes, open your mind, and prepare for a ride on the Starship Sandwich! Ten minutes of soaring cosmic space-psych that reminds me of classic Ash Ra Tempel's tripped out guitar/electronica. Spacerock at its finest. Census Of Hallucination contains a variety of themes, all of which seem to synthesize the SP crew's many musical interests, but carry them up to the most astral of planes. Well crafted songs and cosmic instrumentals. And all of it good medicine for your head.\nReview by Jerry Kranitz http://aural-innovations.com/stonepremonitions/bands/coh/coh08.html\n1.

            "description": "Stone Cold Fiction - Strange Time (New Full Album) Strange Times, the debut album from Brighton based trio Stone Cold Fiction, originally landed on streaming services and CD in October 2019. Strange Times instantly drops us into Stone Cold Fiction’s own world. A terrific riff starts things proper and pulls us into the dark and atmospheric Mary with a heavy yet still accessible sound that is rare to hear in the current generically polarised world of non-mainstream music.\nCCTV meanwhile adds a jazzy twist then Slowburner brings more of the really stoner style grooves that have a strong suggestion of Black Sabbath along with some Pink Floyd style prog. The groundwork laid by these shorter tracks then seems to pay off with the far more epic Avoiding In A Way that combines heaviness and jazziness, with a surprising level of clean accessibility within the fuzz, to create the album’s first real highlight that, for those familiar with them, comes across like a heavier version of Guernsey grunge merchants Tantale.\nThe climb seems to start again after that crescendo with Mind On Trial but with its eyes on a higher peak. As the fuzzy heaviness of slides almost casually into the dark radiance of End the scene is again set for something more and that comes with the ten-minute peak of Landscape. A tremendous slow-burning epic, Landscape begins with hints of Spanish and classical style guitar lines gradually building with rumbling bass and atmospheric drums to a terrific, cathartic, climax that is followed by some noodling that feels like a storm moving into the distance.\nThat mood continues with a kind of post orgasmic feeling on Catatonia that wraps the record up making it a complete and satisfying journey through Stone Cold Fictions’ intriguing mix of doom, stoner and jazz rock that doesn’t just show them as being extremely advanced for a band so new, but also that they have the potential to appeal far beyond their own, already dedicated, fan base.\nReview by https://tommygirard.wordpress.com/2020/03/11/stone-cold-fiction-strange-times/\n1.

The Swedish/Uruguayan craziness is all about energy and it's something you need to experience live with your own eyes, ears, body and soul.  \"Everything Is A Problem\" is Something Dead's second EP, filled with energy and heavy riffs.",

The Swiss four piece jam through six tracks that'll chill you out and brighten your mood.  What started in autumn 2015 with extensive jams slowly assumed a more structured shape. The result was a mixture of different stylistic elements characterized by instrumental, partly spherical, partly heavy fuzz sound. Heavy Psychedelic Sud Rock was born.\nThe debut album \"Submerge“ was recorded live in the legendary \"Foolpark“ record studio Lucerne and released on the first of December 2018. It depicts a journey down into the depths of beautiful, spacey soundscapes all the way to the bottom of a peculiar ocean, where downtuned guitars and fuzzy, transparent riffs await your arrival.  This is high quality stoner of the psych end, of Rotor or Los Natas and their ilk, and hard to feel anything else but a warmth towards it.\n1.  Submerge - 0:00\n2.  Cold Seep - 10:08\n3.  Aberration - 16:55\n4.  Martini Effect - 32:37\n5.  36070 - 37:12\n6.

Seeping forth from the cracks of man’s doubt, Yaldabaoth’s ‘That Which Whets The Saccharine Palate’ is a study of disgust, contempt, and mockery for all of religion's existential justifications. Set to the backing of technical black/death metal that is at moments pummeling and others ominous, the album explores the fractures and faults of devout belief. Dripping in cynicism, Yaldabaoth grants no god or faith a reprieve from their cynical view.\n1.  Fecund Godhead Deconstruction\n2.  Megas Archon 365\n3.  Gomorrahan Grave of the Sodomite\n4.  To Neither Rot Nor Decay\n5.  That Which Whets the Saccharine Palate\n6.  Mock Divine Fury\nWritten and recorded by the Lycaean Triune at the Unsafe Space in Anchorage, Alaska, with mixing and mastering by BST Studios & artwork by Pierre Perichaud (Business For Satan).

Seeping forth from the cracks of man’s doubt, Yaldabaoth’s ‘That Which Whets The Saccharine Palate’ is a study of disgust, contempt, and mockery for all of religion's existential justifications. Set to the backing of technical black/death metal that is at moments pummeling and others ominous, the album explores the fractures and faults of devout belief. Dripping in cynicism, Yaldabaoth grants no god or faith a reprieve from their cynical view.",

            "description": "Dave Talon - Butch It Up (Full Album) Butch It Up is an amazing blend of catchy rockin tunes from the man that brought you Rollerball & The Marlboro Man.  From the first few notes of the opening track to Dave Talon’s solo album Butch It Up, it’s evident he’s a champion of classic rock who grew up listening to a hell of a lot of music from the golden era when Vanda & Young ruled the turntables of suburban Australia. With his Malcolm Young power chords setting the foundation for his Iggy Pop cool voice to sing the catchy melodies, Butch It Up is a solo effort of sorts with Dave being credited as providing the vocals, instruments and mixing the album while offsider Fernando Marlboro played drums and percussion.\nThe album was recorded at Bernie’s Bunker Barn by José Marlboro in Switzerland where ex Gold Coaster Talon now resides. The title track is first cab off the rank with its hard hitting open chords tipping a hat to The Angels/Rose Tattoo school of rock. The track is augmented by a choir of histrionic background ohs that would make classic underground Oz band The Johnnys proud of its Spaghetti Western stylings. I’m Not Go’n Down Alone and its Queens Of The Stoneage-ish groove is driven by a low tuned guitar riff and lyrics detailing the story of a meeting of two minds on ecstasy, while Push Out The Jive and its Native American sounding tom toms bring the western vibe again as the AC/DC guitars and catchy chorus have you screaming for more cowbell!\nLovers of old school KISS will love the gallop of The Flame and the song’s Ace Frehley influenced lead guitar solos whileThe Power Of Dynamite again brings an Angels’ vibe. Laze In The Sun is a classic stoner rock shuffle with the throaty growl of a Gibson guitar providing tasty licks.  The cruisier moments of She Ain’t Mine have a J Mascis vibe which lead on to another foot stomper in The Dead Man’s Twist, lyrically detailing a ghoulish tale of a party at the local cemetery featuring icons from days of yore. Final track, Delicate Flamingo is the summer acoustic offering of the album and rounds out a damn cool collection of songs, likely to be set to high rotation on your stereo if you give it a listen.\nReview by Rick Hollis https://blankgc.com.au/album-review-dave-talon-butch-it-up/\n1.

            "description": "Sautrus - Reed: Chapter One (Full Album) Sautrus is a heavy tuned psychedelic/stoner band from Northern Poland formed in 2010. They combine deepest late 60`s elements with hard driven metal influences and create a completely unique and mindblowing sound!  Sautrus bring a fuzz factor that flows from desert stoner groove into Herculiffic riff tides of pummeling metallic force. The vocals maintain a smooth and melodic abrasiveness sailing effortlessly alongside a variable sequence of chugging riffs and doomy, psychedelic atmosphere. The arrangement throughout the 8 song full length debut keeps things interesting with some shorter instrumental breathers on songs 3 and 6 which really strengthen the album overall. Throbbing drums reinforce the galvanic guitars while vocal chants echo in and out of tripped out solo freak outs.\nHighlights include the opening number Ricochet, Kuelmagga Part 2, Iomi Iomi, and the epic closer Suentist. That's half the songs. The other half round it out nicely and are split between their heavy, mellow, psychedelic and melodic natures giving the overall album high marks. There is a strong 'metal' vibe lurking throughout the stoner rock ensemble of noise. Reed: Chapter One confidently builds upon the prologue in terms of overall impact. Whether you prefer mustard, sauerkraut or both, these Polish rockers leave your appetite quenched and satisfied.  Not only is there two capitol S's in the band name but their music takes on 2 of my favorite aspects of hard rock music; Dark and Melodic vocal tones combined with immaculately distorted guitar riffs and cathartic solos to die for.\nReview from The Ripple Effect https://ripplemusic.blogspot.com/2014/07/sautrus-reed-chapter-1.html\n1.  Ricochet - 0:00\n2.  The Knurr - 3:47\n3.  Djumbledore - 7:57\n4.  Kuelmaggah Part 2 - 9:18\n5.  lomi lomi - 16:17\n6.  FA`YKA YE`VE DOMOO - 20:26\n7.  LOSAO - 22:15\n8.

            "description": "Your Inner God - Monochromic (New Full Album) Your Inner God make wild and dark garage blues rock, stoner and psychedelic rock from the distant backwoods of Ukraine. Monochromic is their new full album, recorded in Kharkov at On-Air studio. The essential in Monochromic is the aesthetic beauty and the application of synesthesia to the visual component of music, the search for subtle changes in emotions in b/w. Actually, the idea of the album is to evoke listener’s emotions - therefore, the title of the album intentionally contradicts the content and its meaning. As you can see from the titles - the album is the vessel, that picks the listener up at Arrival, sending him right into the head of Your Inner God, while in the end, the listener can’t help, but run away from oneself as if from Jailer.\nConflicts in the dynamics of music, atmosphere and gravity, in the head of the artist and listener from superficial apathy and inner rainbow of anxiety. The whole conceptualism here conveys the absence of concepts, as during search of meaning the author dives deeper and deeper into himself, ans just like the listener finds his own inner God.\n1.  Arrival – 0:00\n2.  Red Sky – 3:53\n3.  Blend - 14:36\n4.  Bliss – 16:04\n5.  Monochromic – 21:02\n6.  Colour Haze – 26:36\n7.  Threads – 34:04\n8.

Monochromic is their new full album, recorded in Kharkov at On-Air studio. The essential in Monochromic is the aesthetic beauty and the application of synesthesia to the visual component of music, the search for subtle changes in emotions in b/w. Actually, the idea of the album is to evoke listener’s emotions - therefore, the title of the album intentionally contradicts the content and its meaning. As you can see from the titles - the album is the vessel, that picks the listener up at Arrival, sending him right into the head of Your Inner God, while in the end, the listener can’t help, but run away from oneself as if from Jailer.",

            "description": "The VillainZ - Sexy & Arrogant (New Full Album) The VillainZ was founded in June 2016 by Jess and Nic K, a sulfurous duo hooked on sex, booze and horror.  In 2017 they released their debut EP and now follow that with their new debut full length album 'Sexy & Arrogant'!  The VillainZ blast stoner-flavored punk rock riffage non stop. The VillainZ are hot in every sense of the word: charring riffs, sweaty shows, and of course, the blazing looks of Jess K. But the brighter the fire, the darker the shadow, and The VillainZ's dark side is not buried deep. Jess delights in providing more-than-explicit lyrics inspired by real-world horror stories, her own bleak fantasies and even the genitals of some handpicked friends.\nTwo years after the release of the first EP, The VillainZ strike again, this time with a nice LP in due form. Things do not get better, since the bottle and the bat are replaced with blades and flames. Ouch ! As for the music, we've got ten in-your-face tracks with monstrous production. The originals confirm the identity of the band, with Jess's vocals more bewitching and the line-up more solid than ever.  They are currently looking for a record label to work with going forward.\n1.  Bloody Milk - 0:00\n2.  Beyond Experience - 5:33\n3.  Nobody - 9:31\n4.  No Apologies - 13:47\n5.  She - 18:11\n6.

In 2017 they released their debut EP and now follow that with their new debut full length album 'Sexy & Arrogant'!  The VillainZ blast stoner-flavored punk rock riffage non stop. The VillainZ are hot in every sense of the word: charring riffs, sweaty shows, and of course, the blazing looks of Jess K. But the brighter the fire, the darker the shadow, and The VillainZ's dark side is not buried deep. Jess delights in providing more-than-explicit lyrics inspired by real-world horror stories, her own bleak fantasies and even the genitals of some handpicked friends.",

            "description": "She Loves Pablo - Death Threats From Future Self (New Full Album) She Loves Pablo is a 4-piece groove rock band from Zagreb, Croatia.  Death Threats From Future Self is their new full length album, released in January, 2020. She Loves Pablo drop a dynamic package in discerning stereos; serving swift-flowing stoner rock, scuzzy Seattleite sonics and muscular metal munitions in any given three minute span. Vocalist Domagoj Šimek is no less potent or verbally cogent, seamlessly adapting his delivery to those changing gears 'n' grooves.\nStaying loyal to SLP sound but veering into more classical stoner waters, the band widens its appeal and confirms their rightful place amongst some of the most prominent artists of the groove stoner genre in the 21st century. And groove is the word my friends, opening track “Crumble” proves from the word go. Pacey, hard hitting, and crunchy at times, “Crumble” is a perfect numero uno, your own ticket to the rollercoaster ride that starts in a manic riff driven way, and carries thru “Operator” and “All Black”. Things then slow down with “You Were Born To Breath My Mind” but only in tempo as a cannonball of riffs ensue, like an alchemist searching for that secret element, burning with desire and excitement and apprehension at the same time.\nVocals sang by frontman Domagoj come to the fore, especially evident in “When It Stacks, It Makes The Summer Black” that shows his potent and vibrant vocal abilities demonstrating a full and flawless spectre.  “Death Threats From Future Self” is a great stoner rock album, and delivers on many levels. Return of a founding member drummer, together with a new bass player definitely adds a new dimension, but importantly the band builds on and continues a clear path to bigger and better things. She Loves Pablo isn’t your next door stoner band, they hail from Croatia. That makes them even more interesting, never mind the quality material the band has been putting out for the past 12 years. So if you do anything this year, make yourself a promise to go and check them out live.\nReview by http://baltazar-rock.com/she-loves-pablo-death-threats-from-future-self/\n1.  Crumble - 0:00\n2.

Purple Corporation features two musicians, Miles Donnelly and Matt Williams, along with some other talented individuals from the University of Chicago. Fall through the Gaps In Time and hitch a ride on Purple Corporation’s sonic spaceship. This EP marks a significant change in style for Purple Corporation, and is the first release since the group’s reformation as a 5-piece band featuring Miles From Space (vocals & trumpet), Jacob Walter (guitar), Nick Olosky (guitar), Matt Williams (bass) and Sam Jacobson (drums).

With a little bit of magic and a dash of science they combine an eclectic mix of genre to capture a multigenerational appeal, creating their signature psychedlectric sound.\n1.

            "description": "Smoke Mountain - Queen Of Sin (New Full Album) Florida-based occult fuzz rockers Smoke Mountain bring forth their hotly anticipated debut full length album, 'Queen Of Sin'.  Smoke Mountain, which is the brainchild of family members Sarah, Lee and Brian Pitt, introduced stoner and doom fans worldwide to its doomy, fuzz-drenched sound in 2017 with the release of its highly acclaimed self-titled EP. The band combines elements of vintage and modern doom to create a sound that is both current and timeless.

            "description": "The Slayerking - Tetragrammaton (New Full Album) The Slayerking is a three piece dark metal act founded in 2013. It was formed as an unofficial studio project of Efthimis Karadimas, frontman of the infamous Greek Black Metal band Nightfall, with the purpose of sailing slower into darker musical ecosystems.  The sound of The Slayerking is dark with lots of low end primarily due to Β tuned baritone vintage guitars and big drums. At the same time it maintains an aggressive tone thanks to the characteristic nervy, “punky” way EK and KK play their bass and guitar respectively.  Definitely aggressive and fat.\nTheir main target is to promote The Slayerking's theatrical part. Main inspiration for visual part is Alexandro Jodorowsky’s ‘73 movie The Holy Mountain. This surreal mix of landscapes and lose,\nbroken characters whose civilized manners melt under a merciless sun find in Tetragrammaton the perfect soundtrack. Musically one can find an enormous capacity of Heavy Metal, Dark Rock,\nDeath Metal, Doom Metal, Prog Rock, or even Punk Rock seeds. It’s all there artistically wrapped in crispy layers of anger and frustration. New album, Tetragrammaton is the album Celtic Frost could have released after 87’s Pandemonium.\n1.  Intro to Your Darkness - 0:00\n2.  Bless those who Weep and Sell their Tears to Unbelievers - 0:29\n3.  We Crucified the Pilgrims they Believed in You - 4:24\n4.

            "summary": "The Slayerking - Tetragrammaton (New Full Album) The Slayerking is a three piece dark metal act founded in 2013. It was formed as an unofficial studio project of Efthimis Karadimas, frontman of the infamous Greek Black Metal band Nightfall, with the purpose of sailing slower into darker musical ecosystems.  The sound of The Slayerking is dark with lots of low end primarily due to Β tuned baritone vintage guitars and big drums. At the same time it maintains an aggressive tone thanks to the characteristic nervy, “punky” way EK and KK play their bass and guitar respectively.  Definitely aggressive and fat.",

Inspired by bands such as Pink Floyd, Santana, Sleep, The Re-Stoned, and Earthless, Liquify is a one-man project from the United States that strives to bring balance to the Rock. Beginning with Aurora, the dual guitars are introduced along with a steady bass that gradually builds to a climax. Vibrant has a groovy flow that is complimented by the bass riff with the guitar licks as the icing on the cake. The Stars Dance Above Us builds into something greater and has a reminiscent feel about the strangeness of what lies above us. Dust City Blues offers an old western style with a touch of the 70s rock. Desertman leads into a groovy trip and might be something one would expect while driving through the desert on a blazing hot day. Finally, Voyage of the Sun is a lengthy distortion driven journey of the Sun that ascends towards its climax and claims its position as the longest song on the album.\n1.  Aurora - 0:00\n2.  Vibrant - 7:12\n3.  The Stars Dance Above Us - 11:29\n4.  Dust City Blues - 20:58\n5.  Desertman - 24:49\n6.

In 2011, they released a first full-length studio album, Our Zoo, followed in 2013 by a second self-released album, called Shiva Telescopes.  After some silence, the band returned in 2016 with a digital EP, The Smell Of Space, and very recently, with a renewed line-up, Flynotes released Child In The Woods in 2018.  Now they've released their brand new album 'The Goddess Of Sunrise'.  What the trio brings is an instrumental mixture of different yet closely related styles and sub-genres, such as Doom Metal, Stoner, Psychedelic, Post Rock and Progressive. The material is guitar-based, done by extremely heavy electric guitar riffs and monumental leads.  The melodies are supported by a truly fantastic rhythm section, which includes pushing and pounding rhythm guitars, almost hypnotic bass lines and monumental drum patterns.\n1.

Vintage style doom metal for the like minded, carefully crafted from years of riff worship at the alters of European and Western descendants of Sabbathian influence, and their progenitors.

Ethereal Sea is a stoner rock band formed in the forests of the Pacific Northwest amongst the wildest mushrooms, tallest trees and thickest moss. Always ready to flood your ears with muddy riffs and bong rips using soggy pine needles as daily inspiration. Ocean is the first song from their upcoming new album! The song tells a tale of a young Shepherd whom through lifelong struggle and hardship searches for that which killed his true love. Does he find it? Or must he come to terms with the raging waters of the mind and no longer fear the waters which drown his sorrows.\nLyrics:\nHe was a man of misfortune pushed to his knees\nBy the iron grips that seem to oversee\nWell he’s traveled these great lands,\nIn search of what he cannot see\nThere’s love in his potion and warm blood on his feet\nWhen he was younger his lover was stricken ill\nHis heart became heavy and his soul became still\nOn a quest for the unspoken, he set for the hills\nWay over yonder, maybe he’ll find his kill.\nHold under water, until I’m lying still\nBecause my heart still yearns for you baby,\nIn these rolling hills\nHold me under water, till the lion crawls out my chest.\nYou may jump through the ring of fire, but can you tame the beast\nNever fear the ocean, just mind the waves\nJust mind the waves\nHold me under water, until I crawl out my skin\nIve been waiting for days girl, wont you let me in.\nHold e under water, til the lion crawls out my chest.\nYou may jump through the ring of fire, but can you tame the beast\nNever fear the ocean, just mind\nJust mind\nJust mind\nJust mind the waves\nMind the waves.\nSupport Ethereal Sea here https://etherealseamusic.bandcamp.com/track/ocean\nhttps://www.facebook.com/eseamusic/",

            "description": "Big Scenic Nowhere - Vision Beyond Horizon (New Full Album) Anyone familiar with the terms “Stoner Rock” or “Desert Rock” have surely heard the names Fu Manchu or Yawning Man. If you’re a die hard fan of the genre, or a causal observer, you know that both bands have been dishing out quality material since the beginning. While stylistically different, both band occupy legendary status. Fu Manchu’s sun-drenched, stratospheric, fuzz worship sound and Yawning Man’s ethereal, ambient delay have never been crossbred until now. It’s certainty a good time to be alive if you’re a fan of either band. We bring you Big Scenic Nowhere!\nBig Scenic Nowhere‘s debut full-length, the nine-song/44-minute Heavy Psych Sounds LP Vision Beyond Horizon, is almost entirely more cohesive in its purpose, blending some of the proggier elements of the EP into washes of Mellotron and Wurlitzer on side-ending pieces like “Hidden Wall” and “War Years” as Tony Reed becomes an essential third collaborator in the band alongside Balch and Arce. This album is a collaborative effort and even greater than the sum of its parts. The basic riffs and song structures were done by Bob Balch and Gary Arce, but the contributions from Tony Reed, Lisa Alley, Ian Graham, Mario Lalli, Nick Oliveri, Bill Stinson, Per Wiberg and Alain Johannes make this record what it is.\nThis album is a unique gem, manufactured by multiple artists, including different atmospheres: from the melodic stoner mellowness, to faster tempos, to classic heavy sounds, but songwriting is never customary. We can say, “Fu Manchu’s killer riffing meets the desert psychedelia of Yawning Man.” Bob Balch and Gary Arce together give life to an amazing new adventure which sounds fresh and dynamic.  The vocal parts are always choral and interesting. There’s a variety in the songs which always keeps the listener focused and intrigued about what’s next. This is a very special record and deserves your full attention, because we predict that over time you will hear different elements within it. So dig in and get lost. Let your journey begin.\n1.

            "summary": "Big Scenic Nowhere - Vision Beyond Horizon (New Full Album) Anyone familiar with the terms “Stoner Rock” or “Desert Rock” have surely heard the names Fu Manchu or Yawning Man. If you’re a die hard fan of the genre, or a causal observer, you know that both bands have been dishing out quality material since the beginning. While stylistically different, both band occupy legendary status. Fu Manchu’s sun-drenched, stratospheric, fuzz worship sound and Yawning Man’s ethereal, ambient delay have never been crossbred until now. It’s certainty a good time to be alive if you’re a fan of either band. We bring you Big Scenic Nowhere!",

            "description": "Transylvania Stud - White Witch (New Full Album) Virginia born Andrew Godfrey is the mastermind being Transylvania Stud. On this project, Godfrey is not limiting himself to just one instrument as he plays drums, guitar, bass as well as vocals. He utilizes the desert doom of Kyuss along with the melodic discord of Soundgarden, to solidify the general themes of what some call space rock, while still being fresh and interesting.\nWhite Witch opens with “Unconditional Numb,” a heavy rock, hair-raising track featuring two other names in Nashville rock you should know; George & Natalie Pauley, two thirds of the band The By Gods. A melodic intro that packs a punch, “Unconditional Numb” is a rich track with phenomenal instrumentals and vocals to be mesmerized by throughout the album. If you are a sucker for hardcore guitar riffs and meaty bass chugs, this album is going to be in your heavy rotation in no time.\nTransylvania Stud is creative, inventive and fun as hell. The energy kicks in full force on the second track, “High Stakes,” a meteoric metal song that rips through your expectations with wild runs of electric guitar and bass chords walking on a razor wire of intensity. “Long Way Down” chugs into the album with subtle drums and bass before squealing into fifth gear with a high voltage electric riff, followed by a sinister chorus. The epic album concludes with “In Over Your Head,” a climactic, yet steady tour de force track, rounding out White Witch with slicing sharp shreds.\nThe guest contributions perfectly compliment White Witch while the master and mix is exquisite. From the cryptic lyrics, spine-tingling execution of the instrumentals and the soul-stirring cover art White Witch surpasses expectations into a realm of the legendary underground album; a truly well-composed, constructed and executed heavy rock album.\nReview by Jessi McKee https://thespinningthoughts.com/2019/11/01/the-new-album-from-transylvania-stud-is-a-truly-well-composed-constructed-and-executed-heavy-rock-album/\n1.

The band’s former lineup created music that contained lyrics, but after being left without a singer and also following the advice of their record label at the time, they decided to stick with instrumental music.\nTheir first album, Handmade (2015) was based on this concept that they tried to improve by new impulses and harmonizations on their following album, Dance (2016). After a short break, the band recorded their newest album, Alaska. The style of the record harkens back to the classic rock music of the 1970s and tries to imitate the old school sounding of that era, with a little bit of modern influence.\n1.

            "description": "Kayleth - Colossus (Full Album) You would be forgiven if you assumed you were basking in the American sun, surrounded by desert in southern California or the swamps and bayous of Louisiana. The way the riffs barrel down from the skies and roll across the rugged landscape are all too similar to the giants roaming, or who have roamed, those lands. The way the songs radiate the lands all around, warming them up and giving birth to new life, and transforming even the most barren corners on the planet. Alas, this colossal power has its origins in the Italian sun; its rays heating up the lands of Verona have stirred the beast by the name of Kayleth from its slumber. The world is in need of healing in these dark times, and their sophomore effort is exactly how the cure should sound: warm, vibrant, and almighty! Enter the Colossus…\nReleased way back in the gloomy beginnings of 2018 on Argonauta Records, Colossus came out of nowhere demanding an audience, igniting the ashen hearth ablaze with the promise of a brighter tomorrow, and leading a procession of gallant followers – fed by good vibes and magmatic furore – into the cold of night. With the immediacy of a starting pistol, Kayleth’s follow-up to the splendour that is Space Muffin fills the listener with a warmth so intoxicating it is almost impossible to abscond from; their souls glowing with the rich hues emanating from the album’s lush tones. Forging the rhythms synonymous with ‘90s grunge with the bold fuzz and heaviness mastered by legendary acts such as Kyuss and Monster Magnet – like some lovechild between Pearl Jam and Sigirya – it’s difficult to realise this is only Kayleth’s second album in their thirteen year existence; their ability to craft such sunkissed tunes ought to be known throughout the stoner rock community, more so as summer is just around the corner, for these twelve songs are crying out to bask in the scorching glory of our celestial neighbor.\nWhat sets Kayleth apart from their contemporaries is exactly this, as few bands deliver such warmth with their level of consistency, especially with Enrico Gastaldo’s pipes soaring above Massimo Dalla Valles’ eruptive riffs and Alessandro Zanetti’s smouldering bass rumbles; interwoven into these grooves are the pulsating synths masterfully projected by Michele Montanari’s psyche. Colossus is song after song of this: from the glistening space rock of ‘Ignorant Song’ and the introspective meditations of ‘The Spectator’ and ‘Pitchy Mantra’ to the frenetic Clutch-like ‘So Distant’ and the crushing doom of the sci-fi-laden ‘Mankind’s Glory’ – no doubt the highlight on an album full of instant classics – there is no end to the positive and uplifting energy this band seamlessly manifests. Just like some beastly juggernaut, this is energy which continuously builds across the entire runtime right until its hallucinogenic end, culminating in almost an hour of pure feel-good music.\nAnd feel-good it most certainly is: it is difficult not to smile whilst basking in the glow of Colossus’ life-affirming presence. A beacon in the darkness when times are tough, it is fuelled by the intense Verona sun and fused into its beating heart with all the good vibes one would expect from any well-revered stoner rock outfit and deserves just as much attention and success as better-known albums.  The time has come for Kayleth to shake off their underdog status and claim their rightful place as one of stoner rocks greatest discoveries.\nReview by Jamie Cansdale http://www.metal-observer.com/3.o/review/kayleth-colossus/\n1.

            "description": "Alunah - Violet Hour (New Full Album) Brace yourselves, my dear metalheads, as the Stygian clouds of doom are coming to darken the skies to the sound of Violet Hour, the brand new album by UK-based Hard Rock/Doom Metal frontrunners Alunah, one of the best albums of 2019 from the underground and independent scene without a shadow of a doubt. Founded in 2006 in “Sabbath City”, usually referred to as Birmingham, the band comprised of the enchantress Siân Greenaway on vocals, the talented Dean Ashton (bassist for UK’s Hard Rock institution Diamond Head) on the guitar, the unstoppable Daniel Burchmore on bass and founding member Jake Mason on drums is ready to strike once again harder than ever, bringing more riffs, more swagger and more groove to our avid ears with their newborn opus.\nThe 8 tracks on display show the fruits of a productive early 2019 with a searing combination of melodies, riffs and focused writing. From the opening combination of \"Trapped & Bound\" and \"Dance of Deceit\" the album pulls the listener in to an ominous world and doesn't let go until the brooding finale \"Lake of Fire\".  Siân and the boys don’t give us a single second to breathe in the amazing opening track Trapped & Bound, spearheaded by Dean’s heavy-as-hell riffs and Jake’s pounding drums. I dare you to not bang your head to the song’s hypnotizing rhythm, a perfect fusion of the doomed music by Black Sabbath with the badass Sludge Metal played by Crowbar.  The somber, deep and addictive vocals by Siân add an extra touch of evil to the dark and sluggish Dance of Deceit, where Dean and Daniel are merciless with their stringed weapons, not to mention Dean’s amazing solo as the icing on the cake.\nThen we’re treated to Hunt, a lesson in Doom Metal by Alunah sounding slow and enthralling form start to finish, with Jake’s beats bringing nuances of melancholy to the music while Siân beautifully declaims the song’s devilish lyrics. In 'Hypnotised' the name of the song says it all, with Dean being on fire with his demonic riffage and solos while Daniel couldn’t sound more thunderous on bass. Hence, it keeps the album at a high level of heaviness and darkness, being therefore recommended for all your beer-drinking, headbanging moments in life, whereas the title-track Violet Hour is just as mesmerizing and delicious as its predecessors, with Siân’s vocals sounding so powerful it’s hard to describe them in just a few words, and with Dean slashing our ears and minds with his grim guitar lines.\nJake smashes his drums fiercely in the also obscure and sexy Unholy Disease, one of those Doom Metal songs that will put you in a trance, or in other words, your soul belongs solely to Siân during the song’s five minutes of razor-edged riffs, low-tuned bass punches and an endless amount of electricity. Velvet sounds as delicate but at the same time as hot and striking as velvet itself, being the perfect soundtrack for a movie scene at an obscure pub somewhere in the middle of England, while Jake keeps hammering his drums slowly and steady just the way we like it, nicely boosted by Daniel’s metallic, rumbling bass. And crisp guitar lines and an enfolding atmosphere are the main ingredients in Lake of Fire, a dark and serene composition showcasing another flawless vocal performance by Siân supported by the thunderous sounds blasted by her bandmates, making you want to walk into a real lake of fire with her until the song’s ethereal finale.\nReview by  Gustavo Scuderi https://theheadbangingmoose.wordpress.com/2019/09/25/album-review-alunah-violet-hour-2019/\n1.

            "description": "Taraban - How The East Was Lost (New Full Album) Krakow's power psych mongers Taraban open a world of sonic possibilities with their exhilarating debut album 'How The East Was Lost'.  \"Taraban\" is an eastern war drum used to command, set the pace, boost morale and terrify the opposition. The Poland based outfit formed in 2013 and previously released two EPs as a garage rock foursome. If the good old rock is dead, it definitely drowned in their debut LP.\nThe album starts off with the track “Last Laugh” and funnily enough it begins with some creepy laughter following some mellow guitar riffs until the fuzz kicks in. From here we get a nice tasty gain-filled jam session reminiscent of classic Black Sabbath. But things get more interesting when the vocals come out to play because now we here a bit of Soundgarden inspiration. Taraban closes off the opening track with a lengthy psychedelic guitar solo while the bass and drum rock out. “Last Laugh” is an incredible way to open up a great album, and should definitely make you want to hear more of Taraban!\nHow The East Was Lost is a definitive breath of fresh air. Taraban aren’t afraid of nuance and are definitely not scared of removing the fuzz from the guitars and letting them ring clean. There are no shallow ends with 'How The East Was Lost': only 47 minutes that transcend the ages of rock. Taraban is a 7-letter word and this is a 7-track journey into the true heart of Eastern Europe, its state of mind, the epic struggles it induces, as well as the romanticism of being born to lose. Immerse yourself in the lush and refreshing music that springs from the cracks in old rock.\n1. Last Laugh - 0:00\n2. Backseat Driver - 10:39\n3.

            "description": "Temnee - Dialectics (Remastered) (Full Album) Temnee is Heavy Psych/Instrumental Stoner from Tver, Russia. \"Dialectics\", the debut full-length album of Temnee, the band from Tver, Russia, is finally coming out on vinyl via Sound Effect Records! That is powerful instrumental heavy-psych stoner with deep and thick riffs, psychedelic passages, southern blues jams, oriental melodies, a lot of Sabbath's legacy and a krautrock drive.  Temnee was created in 2013 in Tver, Russia. Their first 5-track, \"Astrodiving\" EP, was released in 2014. That cinematic minion with a lot of jams and fat riffs was followed by the full-length album \"Dialectics\", released digitally in 2016. Dialectics is a philosophical concept meaning the evolution of ideas: a dispute where truth is born. It perfectly describes the process of album creation.\nOn \"Dialectics\" Temnee continues exploring cosmic horizons of heavy space rock. Moreover, the musicians have recently immersed into adjacent genres such as kraut and blues. Powerful sound will transfer you first to the opium haze of the Middle East, then to the Martian race! A turn to the foggy and cruel \"Middle Ages\" finally makes you feel the grievous fate of an astronaut living his last moments in outer space.  Spiritualistic session in space. Supersonic travel to singularity on an acid fuzz. Epic odyssey in the depths of consciousness. Hypnotic jams with orgasmic catharsis. Outstanding psychedelic trip iridescent with all shades of outer and inner space, all that's Temnee.\n1.  Steps To Infinity - 0:00\n2.  Doom. To Do Doom - 5:51\n3.  Voron - 10:35\n4.

That is powerful instrumental heavy-psych stoner with deep and thick riffs, psychedelic passages, southern blues jams, oriental melodies, a lot of Sabbath's legacy and a krautrock drive.  Temnee was created in 2013 in Tver, Russia. Their first 5-track, \"Astrodiving\" EP, was released in 2014. That cinematic minion with a lot of jams and fat riffs was followed by the full-length album \"Dialectics\", released digitally in 2016. Dialectics is a philosophical concept meaning the evolution of ideas: a dispute where truth is born. It perfectly describes the process of album creation.",

            "description": "Galaverna - Dodsdans (New Full Album) Galaverna is like a lost Scandinavian folk psych gem. They don’t make music like this anymore. Except they do! Galaverna will spirit you away with strings, flute, percussion, and evocative vocals that weave enthralling tapestries of dreamy darkness. A beautiful vision beautifully realized.  Mystic, mysterious, medieval, mesmerizing, mind-melting acoustic 70s prog folk.  Galaverna hails from Italy and Dodsdans is their debut album, released in September, 2019.\nGalaverna’s Dodsdans is the real deal. This music has lots of names like doom folk or acid folk, but really, the band makes acoustic sounds that resonate like the dark melodic wind as it brushes the branches of oak trees in a very old forest. It’s spooky autumnal Wickerman stuff. The first two tunes work together. “Dods” begins with an acoustic guitar and shadowy vocal. A violin haunts the melody. Bass and drum drop in a beat; then the second song, “…Dans” repeats the acoustic guitar, but a flute flits the melody until the vocals re-emerge (with violin in tow) to capture a sacred moment of chanted dark forest beauty.\nCerberus makes his three-headed appearance in his namesake song. Again, the tune is percussion driven, while vocals sway like ghosts, as a flute dances a bit. Acoustic guitars spar with the violin as the vocals, once again, hover with wooded cathedral respect. Oh—there’s a mellow jolt of electric guitar. The record continues on its oak forest acoustic way. “Smell of Ember” touches tangible wood—but just barely. And a violin, flute, and another electric guitar solo cut through the November mist of the tune, which, once again, is reborn with a wonderful strummed melody worthy of the very best of British folk.\nOh my! “Mother’s Leaving” begins with a Steeleye Span Medieval choral. But then it becomes complex prog folk with a pretty great Medieval riff. A lovely acoustic interlude worthy of (the great) Amazing Blondel follows, which in turn yields to a full-throated flute, violin, and electric guitar mid-section that quick-steps into an up-beat melodic drama, which quells for a moment, only to gain percussion pulse with a violin and flute melodic drive that slowly walks into the sunset of the song. The final song, “Uppvaknande,” stretches to almost nine minutes. Its title is the Swedish word for Awakening, and for the first six minutes or so, the violin driven instrumental section does recall the great sound of Sweden’s own Kebnekaise. There’s a deep pause, and then the final vocal/guitar/piano/song drifts off with that quiet autumnal wind.\nThis is music that touches old spirits. They are ancient spirits that sing their songs with acoustic vibrations and voices. They chant. And they congregate in the midst of darkly wooded cathedrals to rekindle the bonfires of old songs and new songs that brush the lovely branches of oak trees in a very old and very melodic musical forest.\nReview by Bill Golembeski https://soundblab.com/reviews/albums/22229-galaverna-dodsdans\n1.

            "description": "Dirty Sound Magnet - Transgenic (New Full Album) Dirty Sound Magnet is a Psychedelic Rock power trio that will blow your mind away with its unique multi-faceted compositions and virtuosity. From catchy rock’n’roll high-energy rock songs to shamanic psychedelia, a Dirty Sound Magnet album represents an amazing experience for any music lover. At any time, an outburst of raw electrifying energy can transform into emotionally overwhelming and mysterious landscapes made of complex colorful layers.\nWhile the previous album Western Lies was a sarcastic, unrestrained critique of the shortcomings of our western civilization, Transgenic focuses on individual behaviors within it. Drowned in this world of advanced technology and hyper-consumerism, individuals struggle to discover their inner self or communicate with each other. The album lays out a disturbing view of the present and the near future, with the significance of Social Media, and increasingly alarming ecological issues giving shape to an Orwellian dystopia. The egocentric practices inherent to Social Media are mocked by Stavros’ insolent lyrics and tone. The drama and loneliness of “Modern Man” is highlighted across Transgenic, with emotional issues and personal experiences completing the lyrical content.\nMusically, The album draws on the last 50 years of Pop Culture, with some touches of traditional folk music, but as a whole, Transgenic is true Rock. Production-wise, the band plays with light and shade and introduces the terms “Organic” and “Transgenic” as musical concepts. When delving into the organic realm, the sound is warmer, and the recording techniques used are vintage.\n1.  Organic Sacrifice - 0:00\n2.  USA, LSD, BNB, HIV - 3:48\n3.  Rigid Soul - 7:15\n4.

            "description": "Nightstalker - Great Hallucinations (New Full Album) A pioneering act in the Greek stoner rock scene with their debut EP ‘SideFX’, released back in 1994, Nightstalker have signed with Heavy Psych Sounds Records for the release of their eighth studio album ‘Great Hallucinations’ . This album will directly hit your soul. Eight blistering tracks showcase Nightstalker’s colorful sound imprint, combining punchy bass lines, heavy and spacey riffs, all together with Argy’s powerful and melodic vocal. Raw rock ‘n roll, stunning licks and electric haze are the fundamental elements that have kept the band going for more than 20 years.\nSome rolling feedback and a curt, martial drumbeat kicks off the opening track, ‘Black Cloud’, on Great Hallucinations. Drenched in overheated fuzztone guitar, and frontman Argy’s distinctive pipes, they quickly lay the groundwork for the hotbed of rock and roll to come, and the slow-burn of ‘Sweet Knife’ only serves to sweeten the pot. Gentle melodies eventually give way to some chunky riffing to wind the tune out. ‘Sad Side Of The City’ is a slower, slightly psyched-out track with some awesome guitar work and as with all great bands, they’re only as good as the drummer, and this point is highlighted well by Dinos Roulos’ thunderous drumming.\n‘Seven Out Of Ten’ hangs on a similar vibe, with some crazy-cool indulgence in the wah to fatten the lamb before sacrifice. Heavy stoner blues is the name of the game with ‘Cursed’. Loping, liquid bass notes drive it while the guitar licks seems to effortlessly drip from axeman Tolis’ fingers. ‘Hole In The Mirror’ starts off with some poignant and mournful guitar, and a liquid bass run, and gently picks up moment over its duration, building to a huge, distortion-laden monolithic conclusion. The title track, ‘Great Hallucinations’ wraps this up, and gives a slight nod to early Monster Magnet to my ears. With its’ loose, jammy vibe, it’s a neat way to go out too, and the band makes full use of the time and space the song affords them.\nThis album is great rock’n’roll from the opening beat to the final siren, and jam-packed with excellent songs, a testament to the writing skills and playing of the band. Coming from the same era as Kyuss, Monster Magnet and a bunch of other band of similar ilk, Nightstalker have never quite had the same kinda hero-worship bestowed on them, but they have handed out a tonne of excellent albums over the years, with Great Hallucinations being no different, and don’t seem like they’re gonna call it quits any time soon. We should be thankful for this.\nReview by El Jefe http://deserthighways.com/2019/10/05/nightstalker-great-hallucinations-lp-review/\n1.  Black Cloud - 0:00\n2.  Sweet Knife - 3:46\n3.

            "description": "The Cosmic Trip Advisors - Wrong Again, Albert... (New Full Album) ‘Wrong Again, Albert…’ is the quirkily titled debut record from West Lothian, Scotland 6-piece The Cosmic Trip Advisors. Speaking of quirky, the band all have similarly off-beat names: Lesbomb (vocals), El Cap (guitars), Tattie (guitars), The P-Man (keys), Mr Herringbone (bass), Pete The Beat (drums). The opening track immediately proves both robust and enticing. Oh My My My! batters in with some bonesaw-guitar riffage and thumping bass & drums. The sound is fleshed out by smooth organ sounds and the scene is set nicely for vocalist Lesbomb’s entrance – and what a voice she has! Reminiscent of New York Queen Of Rock & Roll Sari Schorr in her grit and range – with a touch of Joanne Shaw Taylor’s smoky tones in there as well – she owns the track with a forceful performance. The song is catchy and propulsive and provides a great rocking intro to the album.\nThere’s tremendous variation in style (acoustic blues, aching ballads and no shortage of crunchy rockers abound) while maintaining a high standard of songwriting. Lonely Since I Met Ya is a dynamic slow blues that opens with dusty, western-sounding guitar and a soulful vocal. The track builds gradually, maintaining atmosphere but getting ever more hard-hitting as it builds to a tone-drenched guitar solo. Next up Had To Have It manages to conjure a more effortlessly sexy vibe than the preceding Sleazy Does It with a great opening line ‘I saw it and I had to have it, just another dirty habit.’ Particularly cool are the changes in pace which happen throughout, always keeping you on your toes.\nWith the lead vocals continuing to astonish, the band’s secret weapon is quickly revealed as the keyboard work of The P-Man. While both guitarists and the rhythm section all deliver great work throughout, The P-Man is the wild card and he brings something to the band’s sound that few groups have these days. I’ve Got It Going On is the most psychedelic cut on the album, and here he very much leads the line with a sound like The Doors Ray Manzarek, but elsewhere he brings in that cool Hammond organ sound which really adds something to every song in the way that King King’s music stands out thanks to their own Hammond organ specialist.\nAs the album moves into it’s final stages everything comes together in the expansive, heartfelt Bottle In Me. Beginning with a delicate guitar figure a few steps removed from Wish You Were Here it soon opens out into a widescreen chorus. The vocal performance is superb and the searching, yearning guitar solo is a perfect cap. The album finishes with Tongue Tied – an atmospheric opening suddenly torn asunder by that buzzing guitar allowing the frontwoman to ascend vocal heights once more, while El Cap, Tattie and The P-Man all get chances to shine on their respective instruments. Unusual band name, unusual bandmember names, strong album artwork and eleven catchy tracks brewed from a slick mix of blues, rock and psychedelia with some standout instrumental performances and a real star turn from the lead vocalist.\nReview by Cameron Arndt http://www.rockandrolltraffic.com/album-review-wrong-again-albert-the-cosmic-trip-advisors/\n1.

            "description": "Thumlock - Lunar Mountain Sunrise (Full Album) Thumlock is a Psychedelic/Stoner Rock band hailing from Wollongong, Australia.  Lunar Mountain Sunrise is their classic from way back in 1999. Available for the first time in 2019 on Vinyl.  In the late nineties Wollongong had began to develop a strong fuzzy guitar rock underground inspired by the successes earlier that decade from Tumbleweed. At the forefront of the movement were four guys taking influence from the likes of Hawkwind and Blue Cheer to create their own brand of heavy psychedelic rock. The band were Thumlock.\nAfter self-releasing their debut EP ‘Dripping Silver Heat’, it was their epic second six track release ‘Lunar Mountain Sunrise’ that propelled the band to wider audiences. The first release on the newly formed local label High Beam Music, the lead track ‘Starquake’ became a staple of Triple J’s heavy music show at the time and gained the band a cult international following. With high praise for the release coming in across the global ‘stoner rock’ underground, the band toured regularly throughout Australia, but never got the chance to tour internationally despite plenty of international tour offers.\n1999 was a time when physical music sales were crashing and therefore ‘Lunar Mountain Sunrise’ was only ever released on CD, never getting the vinyl release it deserved. Now, twenty years later it's finally available on vinyl for the first time. Pressed on high quality 180 gram vinyl and housed in a deluxe gatefold cover with brand new artwork, the release is limited to just 300 copies worldwide.\n1.  Starquake - 0:00\n2.  Dusky Afternoon - 5:00\n3.  The Ornithopter - 8:58\n4.  Jaspers Brush - 15:53\n5.  Summercloud - 23:08\n6.

Like a laboratory where multiple substances are mixed and the boiling points are reached, Acid Alice is the authentic sublimity of the stoner rock rhythms, the psychedelic riffs of the 60's and 70's and the aguardentious voices of classic rock.  The Road is their debut album, released in May, 2019.  Acid Alice brings the heavy in all sorts of form. Gigantic ode to classic arena rock ingrained with the sweltering psychedelics of the 60s with modern stoner rock swagger. An album you can listen to on repeat and never get tired of.

The trio features Vitor Mercez (vocals and guitars), Raul Martins (bass) and Pedro Nascimento (drums), and their sonority goes on horizons close to those of names like Kyuss, High on Fire and Orange Goblin. The sound is very heavy, does not skimp on fuzz and has an inherent aggressiveness. Age of Despair, the group's debut album, was released in mid-April by Monstro Discos and Milo Records is one of the great debuts recorded by a Brazilian band in recent years. With a beautiful cover created by illustrator Cristiano Suarez, the album was made available on digipack CD and can be purchased on the label's website.\n1.  Desert Crows\n2.  Loose Me\n3.

            "summary": "Desert Crows - Age of Despair (New Full Album) Formed in 2017, the band Desert Crows from Goiás is one of the revelations of the Brazilian stoner scene. The trio features Vitor Mercez (vocals and guitars), Raul Martins (bass) and Pedro Nascimento (drums), and their sonority goes on horizons close to those of names like Kyuss, High on Fire and Orange Goblin. The sound is very heavy, does not skimp on fuzz and has an inherent aggressiveness. Age of Despair, the group's debut album, was released in mid-April by Monstro Discos and Milo Records is one of the great debuts recorded by a Brazilian band in recent years. With a beautiful cover created by illustrator Cristiano Suarez, the album was made available on digipack CD and can be purchased on the label's website.",

            "description": "Gorilla - Treecreeper (New Full Album) Treecreeper - the first full length album by Gorilla since 2007’s Rock Our Souls. Preserving the classic Gorilla chest beatin’, full throttle sound, Treecreeper’s 9 (-count ‘em!!!) slices of mind bending, shit storm rock combine elements of stoner, high energy, doom and heavy psych rock honed to razor sharp fuzz-toned perfection. Recorded in good old fashioned analogue at Moles awesome North Downs Studio, Gorilla create a none stop, white knuckle, maximum riffin’ HELL RIDE that will break your ears and loosen your rears! As one review of a recent show stated “Gorilla sound like Blue Cheer, Motorhead and St Vitus all playing in the same room at the same time”!\nGorilla are back to fuzz up your screams and rupture ya spleen in 2019!!\nU.K.’s Gorilla describe their sound as “F*ck the safety net heavy rock n’ roll.” Truer PR words have rarely been spoken, as this under-the-radar power trio blasts a feedback-drenched, 70s fuzz n’ noise assault that sounds a whole lot like the bastard offspring of Mötörhead, Kyuss and Blue Cheer. Treecreeper clubs you with heavy, rowdy, and raw music, high on volume and attitude and low on refinement and social graces. It comes across like a live recording from some back alley dive bar deep in Donkey Kong Country where you’re almost certain to get banana poisoning and a black eye. Now that we have the general lay of the land, let’s get down to the serious monkey business.\nThe band wastes no time getting the party started with the hurly-burly, mega-raucous attack of “Scum of the Earth,” which is an album high point and a terrific example of what the band is all about. The music is heavily reminiscent of Kyuss anthems like “Green Machine,” with that same fuzzed out riff attack and fat, throbbing low-end. The vocals by Johnny Gorilla (no relation) sound like a young Lemmy after a particularly brutal bender. His hoarse snarl adds plenty of greasy charm to the dirty noise the band generates, and his guitar-work packs a ton of silverback swagga. The band goes for a moodier, trippier approach on “Cyclops” and it works quite well, bringing in elements of Uncle Acid and the Deadbeats for an intriguing number.\nA heavy Mötörhead influence takes hold during the loose, bluesy and loud “Gorilla Time Rock n Roll,” replete with cowbell and harmonica solos. It’s far from slick or nuanced, but the sloppy, jammy presentation conveys an infectiously fun vibe. Rampant Clutch-isms appear on the laid back but wicked groove of the title track, and the old timey 70s blues rock leads are great fun. This cut oozes a nostalgic kind of hippie coolness and the lyrics are somehow both dumb and oddly wise. Treecreeper is chest thumping, back hair fertilizing hard rock for the primitives and it’s more fun than a barrel of drunken monkeys. If you’re in the market for a take no prisoners album of meatheaded bruiser rock, this is your Magilla. Even the occasional blemishes can’t derail the boozy, woozy joy ride, and this thing packs more attitude than most albums you’ll hear this year. Go get your pimpanzee on.\nReview by Steel Druhm https://www.angrymetalguy.com/gorilla-treecreeper-review/\n1.  Scum Of The Earth - 0:00\n2.  Cyclops - 3:55\n3.  Gorilla Time Rock n Roll - 10:22\n4.

Yawning Man continue to establish their exceptionally unique approach to rock music on the bands latest album \" Macedonian Lines\" (Heavy Psych Sounds Records) This follow up to the critically acclaimed \"Revolt Against Tired Noises\" shows a further maturing of melody, dynamics and emotion in the bands song writing.  Yawning Mans roots lay at the foundation of the desert rock and stoner rock sub genres however the music the band creates is truly organic and visceral, conjuring a flowing imagery and a emotional response.\nOn this release the band has a darker and massively heavier sound than past recordings as most of these tracks were developed in live performance and then fully realized in the studio. Yawning Man returned to Gatos Trail Studio in the Joshua Tree CA desert to record this album and the space and beauty of the surroundings is ever present in every track. Heavy, beautiful, and delicate. Gary Arce, Mario Lalli and Bill Stinson continue to expand and dig deep with every track.  A band renowned for sojourns into epic instrumental jams, on Macedonian Lines Yawning Man may have reigned in the excess but, overall, they simply sound timeless; conjuring absorbing, ever-evolving, ageless tomes which ebb and flow through seemingly seamless improvisation and a psych style all of their own.\n1.

            "description": "Jesus Chrüsler Supercar - Lücifer (New Full Album) The Swedish Death ’n’ Roll infernal machine Jesus Chrüsler Supercar continues to race at full throttle on the dusty asphalt of the Rock ’n’ Roll highway. Led by their axe-swinging frontman Robban Bergeskans, the Stockholm pack consisting of drum machine Nicke Forsberg and former Refused guitarist Pär Jaktholm has once again entrenched itself in the legendary Sunlight Studio, to record the furious successor of their ruthless album “35 Supersonic”.  For the tough American tone it was banked on Brad Boatright from Audiosiege (Converge, C.O.C., Black Tusk) for the mastering. The result is a malicious, fierce album that merges its various musical influences from dirty Heavy Rock, Doom, Stoner and old school Death Metal into a unique diabolical brew.\nThe four musicians enter the new album “Lücifer” directly with the title track and the first single along with the music video, followed by the dirty uptempo rocker “Flesh ’n’ Bones” before it gets really heavy with “Never Sleep Again” and the Scandinavians really crack it with fat riffs. The “Boogeyman” calls to the circle pit and Jesus Chrüsler Supercar throw a groovy midtempo rammer out of the speakers with the coarse request “Suck On My Balls”. Just in time to launch “Out Of My Head”, a hell of a killer riff steamroller that finally blows your ears away and, at the same time, shakes your stomach with a fat bass sound. Robban’s direct singing burns itself into your head and at the latest with the killer groove in the middle you just want to kick off an angry wall of death!\nThe filthy fast Rock ’n’ Roll song “From Death To Dawn” introduces the last third with a John Carpenter like horror feeling. With the final song “Black Blood”, Jesus Chrüsler Supercar provide a huge surprise and show that they can also play diabolically inspired Retro Rock like The Devils Blood or Doom Metal á la Reverend Bizarre. In a world without Lemmy, Jesus Chrüsler Supercar  are exactly what you need, wrote the British webzine AveNoctum.com. This quotation can be left uncommented, even if the Swedes incorporate significantly more facets into their increasingly complex sound. “Lücifer” reveals how Death ’n’ Roll has to sound like nowadays and is a must buy for fans of hard Heavy Rock, no matter if they like Entombed, Motörhead, High On Fire or Greenleaf!

Led by their axe-swinging frontman Robban Bergeskans, the Stockholm pack consisting of drum machine Nicke Forsberg and former Refused guitarist Pär Jaktholm has once again entrenched itself in the legendary Sunlight Studio, to record the furious successor of their ruthless album “35 Supersonic”.  For the tough American tone it was banked on Brad Boatright from Audiosiege (Converge, C.O.C., Black Tusk) for the mastering. The result is a malicious, fierce album that merges its various musical influences from dirty Heavy Rock, Doom, Stoner and old school Death Metal into a unique diabolical brew.",

And you’re thinking “Holy shit!” right now, you pretty much nailed it. Holy Shit is Nebula’s first LP since 2009’s Heavy Psych, and it quickly puts to rest the question that’s loomed since guitarist/vocalist Eddie Glass, bassist Tom Davies and drummer Michael Amster announced the band’s reformation in 2017. Nebula are still Nebula. It’s there in the inimitable space-grunge of “It’s all Over,” or the take-a-drag-and-be-gone “Let’s Get Lost,” or the way “Tomorrow Never Comes” manages to be so, so heavy and laid back at the same time. It’s in the paradise-psych of “Gates of Eden”.\nSince the days of 1998’s Let it Burn EP and the now-classic To the Center debut album, Nebula have always been just a little more dangerous. Just a little more unhinged. Holy Shit shows this front-to-back for the essential part of their character it is, and yet it’s not trying to be anything they’ve done before, whether it’s those early outings or Heavy Psych or Charged (2001), Apollo (2003) or Atomic Ritual (2005). It’s a sixth Nebula album -- something for which even the most ardent of fans could hardly have hoped.  Nebula creates pure guitar-driven, conscious expanding rock for the 21st century and Holy Shit has everything you could want and need to start the ceremony.\n1.  Man's Best Friend - 0:00\n2.

            "description": "Yung Druid - Yung Druid  (New Full Album) Yung Druid is a London-based heavy doom, psych quartet with low-tuned, riffy guitars and high-pitched melodic vocals. The group’s music is straightforward and solid, without being too complex. The group creates riffy, sludgy, classic metal, in the vein of Black Sabbath, but with some of the psychedelic sensibilities of softer bands like Dead Meadow and Sleepy Sun.  Yung Druid’s self titled album is no disappointment: It’s full of high flying vocals, killer guitar leads, and walls of reverb and distortion. The drums sound great in the mix, with heavy cymbals that are really allowed to ring out and sing. The guitars and bass are down-tuned and heavy, and the vocals never struggle to hit the high notes.\nTake Me to Your Dealer is the album’s riffy opener. It’s a groovy, psych-doom song with X-Files inspired lyrics and a trippy last half that feels like you’re being taken away on an alien abduction trip.  Sleepy Eyes is filled with commanding riffs and has some cool change-ups. Two vocal tracks create nice harmonies throughout the song. Heavy distortion on the guitars and lots of reverb on the vocals give this song some great psychedelic qualities.  Smoke-permeated riffs, classy vocals, lysergic guitars, mind-bending fuzz, and groovy psych. It did not take long for this album to grow on me and earn multiple listens right away. Oozing, psych-y stoner doom with emphasis on spiffy, snaky melodies. Highly recommended! If you’re into 70’s influenced retro rock with tons of riffs, high flying vocals, and plenty of stoner lyrics, look no further than Yung Druid.\nReview from thesonicsofa https://thesonicsofa.home.blog/2019/04/29/yung-druid-release-riffy-70s-influenced-debut-album/\n1.

            "summary": "Yung Druid - Yung Druid  (New Full Album) Yung Druid is a London-based heavy doom, psych quartet with low-tuned, riffy guitars and high-pitched melodic vocals. The group’s music is straightforward and solid, without being too complex. The group creates riffy, sludgy, classic metal, in the vein of Black Sabbath, but with some of the psychedelic sensibilities of softer bands like Dead Meadow and Sleepy Sun.  Yung Druid’s self titled album is no disappointment: It’s full of high flying vocals, killer guitar leads, and walls of reverb and distortion. The drums sound great in the mix, with heavy cymbals that are really allowed to ring out and sing. The guitars and bass are down-tuned and heavy, and the vocals never struggle to hit the high notes.",

            "description": "My Diligence - Sun Rose (New Full Album) Rising up from the streets of Brussels, My Diligence is a band that in recent years have come to transcend rock in their native Belgium with a skill and ease reminiscent of their transatlantic peers. For fans already in the know, the progressive rock aplomb of established acts like Torche, Helmet and Elder resonate wildly in their sound. Big, bold and high in intensity, the Belgian trio deliver a non-stop, ass kicking brand of no-nonsense rock ‘n’ roll that scorches the sky, while leveling the playing field. Progressive, yes, but relatively succinct: the nine songs on Sun Rose clock in between the two- and five-minute ranges, never outstaying their welcome.  “Resentful” opens the show in hypnotic fashion, and you can immediately hear the influences mentioned above. A slow groove beneath a simple riff drives the song, with effects-laden vocals and a simple yet effective arrangement lulling us into its spell.\nIt’s a captivating opener, and the trio waste no time bludgeoning us with the next track, “Hunt the Hunter,” which attacks us in blistering 4/4 time, again dropping a superb riff and vocals heavily influenced by Torche-slightly distorted, but melodically catchy. In fact, much of this song and others wear Torche influences proudly on their sleeves, almost but not quite to the point of aping that band.  ‘Backstabber’ shoves a melodic Prog element through the overwhelming swell with the delicacy of Yes entering a rottweiler’s jaws. The might of the pulverising, Karnivool-esque rhythms is offset by harmonies and leadwork: a delight that’s as delicious as salt and pepper chicken, delivered with the intensity of being force-fed said takeaway by the Krays. As the title suggests, ‘An Asteroid Arrow’ offers a stellar trip through an eighties landscape, the post-Rock power of Then Jerico anchoring the pouting lips of Duran Duran at their finest: that weight glorious and unfathomable.\n‘Flying Poney’ does just that: Get Up Kids meets Dookie-era Green Day, and the diverse nature of this remarkable trio takes another twist, not tethering itself to any particular genre but giving a deafening representation of their own tastes, by their own hand. ‘Lecter’s Song’ throws a similar tangent, this time with Black-Punk leads ploughing shards into a thickened Grunge atmosphere. The band’s well-reputed Torche influence kicks in here but so much thicker, heavier than the more noted outfit. Sailor’s lead guitar, once melodic, then slices through monstrous riffs and rhythms with a euphoric explosion, enough to raise the dead for one last, angst-ridden teenage party.\n‘So Pretty So Cruel’ continues this melodic battery, but with a ‘Pretty In Pink’ sensibility which brings that cheesy pubescence into a thrilling maturity. Closing duet ‘Serpentine’ and ‘Unreal’, meanwhile, epitomise the immediacy and attractiveness of My Diligence: crushing yet deft rhythms showered in shimmering, wailing emotion, firing in and out with the energy and control of a child genius. This kind of music should be unimportant bubblegum, but the fulminating essence of Sun Rose could make it a genre-spanning joy that will be discussed for years.\nReview by Paul Quinn http://www.ghostcultmag.com/album-reviews-my-diligence-sun-rose-mottow-sounds/\n1.

            "description": "Stonerror - Widow in Black (New Full Album) Stonerror is a psychedelic stoner-punk foursome from Poland that have been jamming since 2015. They made a huge impact two years ago with their debut full-length ‘Stonerror’ (2017).  If the first album was fire, let me warn you to buckle in for the fantastically frenetic follow-up! Not only does 'Widow In Black’ (2019) sound fantastic, sonically, the new record is taking us on a thematic joy ride that is sure to warrant your invested listening for the long haul.  Stonerror toggle between a wide range of interlocking styles with confidence, delivering exciting psychedelic touches, grinding desert riffs, soaring choruses, and dreamy post-metal finishes.\nWithout doubt, Widow In Black is one of the year’s most engaging, heart-thumping, hair flying wildly in the wind kind of records. Take for example, the humorously named \"Kings of the Stone Age,” a genuine stoner-pop marvel, which musters the bouncy verve of QOTSA and the fuck-you punk intensity of Mutoid Man. “Revelation” brings us pop sensibilities reminiscent of Torche, while “Hellfire” shreds as hard as anything Radio Moscow or Earthless has brought to the fore. “Ships on Fire”  channels the balls-out fury of ASG, accented by some of those big, bendy, Soundgarden-esque riffs. And I absolutely love those sweet, sweet hooks and licks in “Asteroid Fields.”\nAs with the first record, this Stonerror crew is lightning together. You’ve got Łukasz Mazur on lead vocals and guitar, with Jarosław Daniel shredding it up on guitar, Jacek Malczewski on bass (also pitching in on some nice vocal harmonies), and the steady hand of Maciej Ołownia on drums. It’s an unbeatable, finely tuned machine that feels neither uptight nor undisciplined. They’re just free, man, free. To draw a comparison with Kyuss: if Stonerror was the Wretch of the band’s discography, then Widow In Black is surely its Blues For The Red Sun.  It’s a perfect companion to last year’s The Sea by Somali Yacht Club, not to mention a fine complement to ASG’s Survive Sunrise.\nReview by Billy Goate https://doomedandstoned.com/post/185016127753/stonerror\n1.

They made a huge impact two years ago with their debut full-length ‘Stonerror’ (2017).  If the first album was fire, let me warn you to buckle in for the fantastically frenetic follow-up! Not only does 'Widow In Black’ (2019) sound fantastic, sonically, the new record is taking us on a thematic joy ride that is sure to warrant your invested listening for the long haul.  Stonerror toggle between a wide range of interlocking styles with confidence, delivering exciting psychedelic touches, grinding desert riffs, soaring choruses, and dreamy post-metal finishes.",

            "description": "The Pilgrim - Walking Into The Forest (New Full Album) FINALLY WE ARE READY TO ANNOUNCE THE NEW ALBUM!!!\n* THE PILGRIM - ...From The Earth To The Sky And Back *\nALBUM PRESALE:\nhttps://www.heavypsychsounds.com/shop.htm#HPS141\nRELEASE DATE: October 2nd, 2020\nLISTEN TO THE FIRST SINGLE \"Mexico '84\" in exclusive on Shindig! Magazine... the latest!:\nhttps://www.shindig-magazine.com/?p=4059\nThe Pilgrim is the latest solo project of Gabriele Fiori, frontman of Rome-based outfits Black Rainbows and Killer Boogie. The end result on Walking into the Forest is a space-folk release with a personality unto itself. Songs like opener “Peace of Mind” evoke some of Fiori’s more rocking side, while “Sunset in the Desert” feels like an ode to the acoustic album Kyuss never made, and side B, which starts with the Hawkwind cover “Brainstorm” and ends with the moody strum of “Suite #2” -- originally from Void Generator’s 2004 debut EP; when Fiori was in the band -- hones a cosmic drift and textures that nonetheless remain accessible and organic thanks to their acoustic foundation.\n“The main point in common with Black Rainbows is the diversity of the songs,” Fiori explains. “You have mind-dreams like ‘Dragonfly’ or ‘Sailor,’ or the more folk rock ‘Peace of Mind,’ passing through space with ‘The Time You Wait’ and the melodic-melancholic ‘When I Call Your Name.’” In completing the arrangements, Fiori turned to Black Rainbows drummer Filippo Ragazzoni, and as he says, “Songs came out so spontaneously and easy. I always played acoustic guitar and wanted to push further on this path. The songwriting, rehearsing and recording approach was so different from usual Rainbows or Boogie style, both to me and Filippo for drums, because all the instruments needed to be played smoothly, softly.”\nThe fantastic and dreamy artwork has been accomplished by Marteen Donders The recordings has been realized in Rome at Nero Studio on a fantastic 70's SSL mixing console during the fall 2018 The Mix and the mastering been doon at JD Studio by Pino Santamaria, same engineer who mixed several Black Rainbows albums. With Walking into the Forest, Fiori evokes a sound that is both classic and fresh, melodically rich and creatively constructed. It is a new outlet for Fiori that demands spiritual as well as auditory engagement, and an all-things-permissible sonic context that one can only hope The Pilgrim continues to explore.\nhttp://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2019/01/30/the-pilgrim-walking-into-the-forest-peace-of-mind-premiere/\n1.

            "description": "The Dry Mouths - Memories From Pines Bridge (New Full Album) The Dry Mouths are a power trio based in Almería Desert City, Spain.  'Memories From Pines Bridge’ is their sixth album and was released April 5th, 2019. It is a 40-minute LP composed of 9 tracks performed live as “jam sessions” and instrumental passages of psycho-hypnotic character.  For those familiar with the Almeria-based trio’s past work, it will no doubt seem like something of a departure from their generally straightforward desert-rocking songcraft, which may or may not be rooted in jams, but ultimately pushes much farther out here in songs like “Impromental VII – Moustachette,” a nine-minute off-the-cuff exploration of canyon echoes and cymbal wash, or the earlier “Low Savvia,” which brings a bit of thicker distortion to the dream-toned modus of Yawning Man.\nThe instrumental outing is a departure even just for its lack of vocals, but the resonant tonality and the adventurous spirit of the sonic interaction between the three-piece of guitarist/thereminist Christ O. Rodrigues, bassist Andrés Reyes and drummer Josh Morales makes it a joyful undertaking despite the tragic circumstances of its arrival following the death of Reyes in February.  Memories from Pines Bridge is one of two albums The Dry Mouths will reportedly release in 2019 in that most unfortunate of contexts, and while there hasn’t been any information given on whether it will follow the band’s more established methodology or the the dry mouths memories from pines bridgepattern set forth by these tracks, there’s no denying that what they’re doing here works.\nWith Rodrigues‘ guitar drifting outward in pieces like “Promenade” or “Mangai Maroke” or conjuring desert visions in opener “La Chasseure,” or delving into minimalist ambience on “Bootha,” there’s a sense of patterning behind most of what the band are doing here. With the exception of the aforementioned “Impromental VII – Moustachette” and “El Cairo ’78” right before it, most of the tracks are under five minutes long, and the theremin-laced “L’Enfer” is 63 seconds, so while they range far in the nine songs, it’s still just a 40-minute outing, and that too feels purposeful. Songs ease their way in and gently fade out, like the penultimate “Bootha” or “El Cairo ’78” after “L’Enfer,” and even when The Dry Mouths build a wash, they do so with patience and melodic emphasis. It sounds like it was a joy to make, and that carries into the execution of the songs themselves, as well as the listening experience.\nImmersion is the key. Hypnosis is the key. The Dry Mouths are issuing an invitation to get lost with them. Closer “La Siesta (Sleep Paralysis)” has a little bit of a darker foundation, but the vast, vast majority of Memories from Pines Bridge is dedicated to sweetly melodic instrumentalist passages of these fleeting musical ideas that weave their way in and out fluidly as the album progresses. It’s the kind of record that is exceedingly easy to put on and lose time with. “What just happened?” and on it goes again. Its blend of plotted material and improv keeps things moving in a way that adds a subtle sense of variety, and no matter where the band seems to head, they’re able to bring the listener along with them for the ride. And their scope is pretty broad while being tethered to its desert rock foundation, so while you might get lost in listening to it, the band are never really any more lost than they want to be in their playing.\nReview from The Obelisk http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/tag/the-dry-mouths-memories-from-pines-bridge/\n1.

            "summary": "The Dry Mouths - Memories From Pines Bridge (New Full Album) The Dry Mouths are a power trio based in Almería Desert City, Spain.  'Memories From Pines Bridge’ is their sixth album and was released April 5th, 2019. It is a 40-minute LP composed of 9 tracks performed live as “jam sessions” and instrumental passages of psycho-hypnotic character.  For those familiar with the Almeria-based trio’s past work, it will no doubt seem like something of a departure from their generally straightforward desert-rocking songcraft, which may or may not be rooted in jams, but ultimately pushes much farther out here in songs like “Impromental VII – Moustachette,” a nine-minute off-the-cuff exploration of canyon echoes and cymbal wash, or the earlier “Low Savvia,” which brings a bit of thicker distortion to the dream-toned modus of Yawning Man.",

            "description": "Cracked Machine - The Call of the Void (New Full Album) Based in Wiltshire, UK, Cracked Machine weave together hypnotic grooves, infectious riffs and layers of sonic texture to create compelling and original soundscapes which take fellow cosmic explorers on an exhilarating trip through the cosmos. The West Country, the South East corner of England famed for its history and beauty, is also renowned for producing devastating heaviness with a soupçon of versatility. Step forward Cracked Machine who, since emerging from Wiltshire in 2015, have surfed both cosmos and deserts out of the reach of radar. Second album The Call Of The Void (PsyKa Records) follows on swiftly from last year’s debut I, Cosmonaut and despite the short timespan between the two, it’s a more mature progression.\nOpener ‘Jormungandr’ sees a light sound underpinned by oscillating effects, with growling riffs riding the back of a robust, metronomic beat and Bill Denton’s guitarwork switching from those riffs to a throaty, post-Rock style lead. There’s an element of Desert kings Yawning Man about the chiming chords and middling trot, but with an added emotional depth and sense of might from the growing rhythms: the ponderous tones of the ensuing ‘Illuyanka’ speak of a loneliness around the warmth of a campfire, a feeling of nostalgia whipped up by spring-like airs as both volume and emphasis swell languidly around Denton’s gorgeous solos.\nThe guitar doesn’t hog the limelight, however. The brooding, explosive jam ‘Kirimu’ is as much of a vehicle for Chris Sutton’s fizzing, fluid bass and Clive Noyes’ 80s synth, while Blazej Gradziel’s drums continue as the glue holding it all together. The sombre jangling of ‘Yamata No Orocchi’ again grows wonderfully into adulthood and sees those drums really come to the fore in a blend of power and subtlety, with Noyes’ distant vocal wails an intriguing accompaniment to the low, melodic riff. Gradziel remains a primary factor during the following ‘Azi Dahakar’, his deft yet heavy and easy-paced work giving a solid platform for the poignant, atmospheric keys and Denton’s emotive storytelling.\nRhythm dominates the early stages of the portentous ‘Typhon’, Noyes presenting a constant chord as a spectral underpin for Denton’s later surges of electricity: while picked chords and haunting synth lead euphoric closer ‘Vritra’ and blend to stunning effect during both periods of introspection and fulmination. The Call Of The Void, while showcasing the great talent of all members, is choc-full of the stuff and also displays wonderful songcraft. This is no cracked machine: it’s working in grand harmony.\nReview by Paul Quinn http://www.ghostcultmag.com/album-review-cracked-machine-the-call-of-the-void-psyka-records/\n1.

            "description": "Rollerball - Lost In Space (Full Album) (20th Anniversary Special Release!) Rollerball are a stoner rock band from Queensland, Australia, formed in 1998 and named after the 1975 movie.  \"Lost In Space\" is the first release from Queensland Cone Rocker's Rollerball, originally released back in 1999. Now with bonus tracks including the long lost \"Far Away\". Bath yourself in an Analog induced, Sci-Fi meltdown.\nHere is a blurb by Rollerball founder Dave Talon about the release:\n\"Sometime in late 1997, i ran into Matt Boland in front of the Broadbeach Tavern. i had been combing the Gold coast for a singer to front the power trio i was forming with drummer Jonno Beeswax Keehn, and Matt was on top of a very short list. We had played several shows together throughout the nineties and had previously discussed the possibility of doing a project together. That afternoon on the Broadbeach shoreline, we nutted out a basic plan and in early 1998, along with his former band mate Gav Guvnor McLaughlin, set up shop in a single garage storage space in Burleigh Heads that Beeswax and i were still holding onto after the demise of our previous band Load.\nWithin a few months, we had about a dozen songs and started to entertain the idea of gigging. My long time mate and sometimes collaborator Justin Gane would drop in to our shed rehearsals with friends and a video camera. Justin had been very successful making independent surf videos throughout the nineties and was spending a lot of time sourcing tunes for his releases. He and i had a lot of like-minded ideas about Rock’n’Roll and over a yum cha lunch, we mapped out a plan to get the band into the studio to record some of our songs plus instrumental themes for his videos.\nRocking Horse Studios in the hills behind Byron Bay was the obvious choice. a well-designed traditional studio, isolated from the world with great accommodation and a great house engineer: Anthony Lycenko had recently returned from working as an assistant engineer on top end productions in england and brought an arsenal of old school recording techniques back with him. He was also a great musician with the right temperament and all the tools and instruments needed to complement a retro production. in short: The right man for the job! Rollerball had two sessions at Rocking Horse in 1998. The first before we had played a single gig!\nThe year 2019 marks the 20th anniversary of the release of Lost In Space on Brisbane label Rhythm Ace. That’s a good excuse to finally press it to vinyl. This record is also the debut release for Volcano Vinyl, owned by my old friend Justin Gane.With Justin behind this little project and Alex von Wieding putting his take on the original artwork, i couldn’t be happier.

            "description": "Hhoogg - Earthling, Go Home! (New Full Album) Space is the place where you’ll find Boston improvisationalists Hhoogg, who extend their fun penchant for adding double letters to the leadoff “Ccoossmmooss” of their exclamatory second self-released full-length, Earthling, Go Home!, which brings forth seven tracks in a vinyl-ready 37 minutes and uses that opener also as its longest track to set a molten tone to the proceedings while subsequent vibes in “Rustic Alien Living” and the later, bass-heavy “Recalled to the Pyramids” range from the Hendrixian to the funkadelicness he helped inspire.\nWith a centerpiece in “Star Wizard, Headless and Awake,” a relatively straightforward three-minute noodler, the four-piece choose to cap with “Infinitely Gone,” which feels as much like a statement of purpose and an aesthetic designation as a descriptor for what’s contained within. In truth, it’s a little under six minutes gone, but jams like these tend to beg for repeat listens anyway. There’s some growing to do, but the melding of their essential chemistry is in progress, and that’s what matters most. The rest is exploration, and they sound well up for it.\nReview from The Obelisk http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/tag/hhoogg-earthling-go-home/\n1.  Ccoossmmooss - 0:00\n2.

(New Full Album) Space is the place where you’ll find Boston improvisationalists Hhoogg, who extend their fun penchant for adding double letters to the leadoff “Ccoossmmooss” of their exclamatory second self-released full-length, Earthling, Go Home!, which brings forth seven tracks in a vinyl-ready 37 minutes and uses that opener also as its longest track to set a molten tone to the proceedings while subsequent vibes in “Rustic Alien Living” and the later, bass-heavy “Recalled to the Pyramids” range from the Hendrixian to the funkadelicness he helped inspire.",

            "description": "High Reeper - Higher Reeper (New Full Album) Philadelphia has spawned many a great rock band and you can safely add High Reeper to that list with the impending release of Higher Reeper, their second full-length that builds on the groundwork laid on the quintet’s self-titled album. High Reeper is back with their second release Higher Reeper and they aren’t fucking around. The sound and smell of leather, weed and death now has a hint of Campari and cocaine to color all eight tracks. With the addition of their new drummer Justin Di Pinto, High Reeper has managed to focus their sound and expand it at the same time.\nThe record is darker and heavier than their first offering with guitars that crush you like a tank and lyrics that paint a picture of the world nearing its end. While the sound of Higher Reeper is more focused, at the same time it manages to be more complex and varied. With tracks ranging from ones as heavy as the album opener, “Eternal Leviathan”, to the ethereal ballad “Apocalypse Hymn”, this LP will take you all the way to hell and leave you there to rot. Once again produced, engineered and mixed by bass player Shane Trimble at TTR studios and Delwood Sound and mastered by Mike Tarsia. Solomacello created the incredible cover that captures the mood of the record while giving a nod to classic heavy metal.\n1.  Eternal Leviathan - 0:00\n2.  Buried Alive - 5:15\n3.  Bring The Dead - 9:00\n4.  Apocalypse Hymn - 13:23\n5.  Foggy Drag - 18:44\n6.  Obsidian Peaks - 23:29\n7.  Plague Hag - 28:25\n8.

The album is a seven song cycle following the Hero's journey, as defined by Joseph Campbell in his book \"The Hero With A Thousand Faces.\" The Goal of the album is for the listener to enter the world and participate in the adventure, achieving a sense of transcendence/enlightenment through this.  A little psychedelic, a little sludge, a little bit of several styles and.a really pleasant journey.",

This stoner rock quartet propounds a heavy-duty, blues-inflected vision of space and time modulated by searing guitar riffs and Plutonic percussion. The band’s debut album, \"Inner Space Vol. 1\", invokes a bevy of bodacious spring-time blooms capable of inducing intense and intimate sonic inquiry about the stars about and beyond listeners. Case in point: “Tito 68” drones and rumbles through the atmosphere, rocketlike in it’s determination to rock, while follow-up “Stones” takes full advantage of blues-bound instrumental roots and storytelling. The hidden track at the end, “It’s All Been Done Before” joins earthy melodicism to the starry, sun-strewn heavens in a summary that is strikingly profound.\nReview by Sonic Reducer https://alibi.com/music/55549/Sonic-Reducer-Atomonaut-Sword-Horse-Man-Born-Bl.html\n1.

            "description": "The Black Heart Death Cult - The Black Heart Death Cult (New Full Album) Welcome to the debut album from Melbourne, Australian psych quintet The Black Heart Death Cult.  Welcome to the sonic bazaar! “The Black Heart Death Cult” debut LP is a beautifully constructed piece of gloomy verb-soaked psych rock that shifts seamlessly between tracks & styles and a real 60’s sensibility of melody underpins it all to reveal some deft song writing, skillful musicianship & quality production. Droney psych mantras, sonic opiates & space-glazed kaleido fuzz jams for the all too new dark age. Generous application of the volume dial is recommended.\nThe album is a brooding, gloomy beast that never sits still as it trips effortlessly from the one chord sitar-sling of “Setting Sun” to flute filled space rock of “She’s a Believer” then the wall-of-verb gloomgaze of “Black Rainbow” to the psy-folk interlude of “The Magic Lamp” before bringing the jams with “Aloha from Hell” & that’s just the A side. The B side is heavier & jammier with the spaced out instrumental “Rainbow Machine”, speaker smashing bass fuzzed “Davidian Dream Beam”, the fantastical flute-filled “Seven Gods” before completely exploding into deep space with the closer “We Love You”.\nSparkly magic mountain-drops fall from the outer cosmic reaches in the re-imagined mind-forrest of The Flower Captain. Gloom/doom singer/songwriter Sasha L Smith envisions a brave new dark age of droney bliss in the sonic bazaar. Fret wizard Bill Patching, sub-sonic vibe dealer Deon Slaviero & human time-machine Andy Nunns are well on the magic bus, which we call “The Black Heart Death Cult”.\n1.  Setting Sun - 0:00\n2.

            "description": "Risin Sabotage - Planet Dies (Full Album) Risin Sabotage is a Ukranian psychedelic stoner rock band from Kyiv.  Planet Dies is their 2nd full length album.  Here we have 36 minutes of exploratory stoner doom, creating vibrant soundscapes full of all manner of enjoyable fuzzed-out vibes. Caught somewhere between psychedelic doom and stoner rock, Risin Sabotage make the most of their involvement in both of these styles by plundering the best bits for their rather engaging music. These tracks are trippy and fuzzed out, frequently taking exploratory detours down various different musical avenues in their quest for the perfect jam.\nLargely slow and unhurried, the tracks unfold easily as the band lazily examine whatever musical output appears from their instruments. Occasionally they are gripped by a strange etheric energy and the music becomes more upbeat and focused, although this usually soon lapses back into more laid-back territories before they can get too carried away. The vocals are low in the mix and seem to travel alongside the rest of the music in perfect sync. The singer’s voice is a strong one and suits the music well. His performance is unhurried and sure, just like that of the rest of music really. The band as a whole know exactly what they’re doing with this material, so everything here sounds assured and confident. Planet Dies is a very enjoyable release that shows a band with good ideas and easy execution.\nReview by wonderboxmetal https://wonderboxmetal.com/2017/06/12/risin-sabotage-planet-dies-review/\n1.

The project, founded and spearheaded by guitarist/vocalist Andy Fernando, traveled to the Californian desert to record with none other than Brant Bjork at the helm as producer along with Bubba DuPree — he of Bjork‘s Low Desert Punk Band — and oh hey, Bjork also wound up drumming and contributing vocals to the album. Not too shabby. Valley of the Universe answers the call of its desert-dwelling goals, and has a few choice fuzzy jams to add variety to its more solidly structured material. Bjork makes his presence felt, of course, but is only part of the larger, sun-caked vibe.\nFull Tone Generator started as an idea hatched on the beaches of Australia by Andy Fernando of Australian Stoner rock veterans Don Fernando, and bought to fruition in the Californian Desert by Andy Fernando, Brant Bjork and Brad Young. While Don Fernando were on a break in early 2018, Andy was looking for another outlet for his new songs and took it upon himself to contact the one and only Brant Bjork (Kyuss, Fu Manchu, Brant Bjork and the Low Desert Punks). Andy had met Brant while touring together in Australia in 2017 and the guys had developed a friendship over their mutual love of Gin, Rock n Roll and the Ramones. After some late night text messages and emails Andy sent Brant some of his new demos and asked if he would be interested in working together on a new project.\nAndy’s vision was to take his new songs into the spiritual home of stoner rock and record them with one of the forefathers of the genre, Andy needed a drummer and producer, luckily Brant is both, Brant proposed that they head out into the desert and setup a mobile studio in a remote location to record an LP with Brant playing drums and producing the record with the assistance of Bubba Dupree. In June 2018 Andy and Brad headed over from Australia to Brant’s zainaland studio where he recently recorded his new solo album and laid down the debut album for Full Tone Generator – Valley Of The Universe. The album is available now for digital and CD preorder via Bandcamp.\nReview from The Obelisk http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2018/10/09/full-tone-generator-valley-of-the-universe-release/\n1.

            "description": "Automaton - Talos (Full Album) Automaton is a psychedelic Doom band from Athens, Greece. What if Talos, the mythical metal giant of Crete and archetype automaton, awakens in the modern era to fight injustice and protect the innocent? This is the narrative of Automaton’s second full length release (due out on November 16th via Sound Effect Records), a carefully crafted concept album spanning 48 minutes in which Talos spreads pure catastrophe. Dark and dangerous, with a cinematic quality that rises throughout their relentless groove and into the fabric of their cold, ever-expanding universe, \"Talos\" offers some outstanding doom/drone thrills, exploring at the same time the boundaries of the genre: heavy guitars, psychedelic black metal, sludge and drone elements merge seamlessly, while a very special guest, the legend of traditional Cretan music Psarantonis, sings and plays the lyra on the key track Talos Awakens.\nIf Automaton’s debut album \"Echoes of Mount Ida\" provided the setting, now \"Talos\" is where the real action is! Recorded at Electric Zen Studios Athens, June 2017. Produced by Automaton and Mike Kavvadias. Engineered and mixed by George Leodis. Mastered by Brad Boatwright at Audiosiege Studio. Talos will be released on November 16th in 3 limited vinyl editions, digipack CD and digital. Automaton were formed in 2011 in Athens, Greece and have been performing live since mid-2012. During the last year, they have opened for Pentagram, NAAM and Belzebong and have participated in various shows and festivals in Greece. Automaton has been characterized as a loud and heavy doom act but apart from slow tempi and down tuned guitars, they blend heavy riffs, repetitive minimalistic patterns and psychedelia into their own style.\n1.

What if Talos, the mythical metal giant of Crete and archetype automaton, awakens in the modern era to fight injustice and protect the innocent? This is the narrative of Automaton’s second full length release (due out on November 16th via Sound Effect Records), a carefully crafted concept album spanning 48 minutes in which Talos spreads pure catastrophe. Dark and dangerous, with a cinematic quality that rises throughout their relentless groove and into the fabric of their cold, ever-expanding universe, \"Talos\" offers some outstanding doom/drone thrills, exploring at the same time the boundaries of the genre: heavy guitars, psychedelic black metal, sludge and drone elements merge seamlessly, while a very special guest, the legend of traditional Cretan music Psarantonis, sings and plays the lyra on the key track Talos Awakens.",

            "description": "Aura Blaze - Aura Blaze (Full Album) Lush vocal harmonies, soaring guitars, swirling organs, epic orchestral passages... All of this and more describe Lebanon Township, New Jersey psychedelic rock act Aura Blaze, fronted by vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Rhode Rachel. Infusing the timeless vibes of the 60's and 70's in a catchy and memorable brand of psych rock, Aura Blaze carries one back to the high times of The Doors, Pink Floyd, and Strawberry Alarm Clock while simultaneously tripping through the hallucinogenic atmosphere akin to modern psych revival bands such as Tame Impala, The Black Angles, and Temples.  This is their self titled debut album. released in 2015.\n“Life is a Lucid Dream” sounds like a late Beatles song. There’s plenty of existential dilemmas presented. The vocal harmonies are really outstanding, crafting a wonderful psych rock style that feels like it could have been recorded in the 60s. The following “It’s a Ride” has some really cool elements to it, which is how the band won their way to this review. My favorite part of the track is the glowing guitar that leads to the killer vocal harmonies. It sounds like another time, but also feels really fresh and new. A Glass of Tears Half Empty” is a dynamic psych rock track. The song rises and swells with pure rock energy. Then the following “The Velveteen Valleys” takes off in another cinematic direction, conjuring images of bucolic places. The style must be terribly difficult to compose and create, but it makes for a playground for the ears.\nRead the full review here http://www.eartothegroundmusic.co/2017/05/03/album-review-aura-blaze-winners-of-newmusicfriday-ep-40/\n1.

The Marlboro Men hail from Brisbane, Australia.  They are the brain child of Dave Talon, a very talented rock n roller.  Who Says You Can't Get High at 95mph was released back in 2012, and from the title you pretty much know what to expect here.  This is straight up Stoner Rock with a Desert flavor.

            "description": "Yawning Man - The Revolt Against Tired Noises  (New Full Album). Apparently described by Brant Bjӧrk as “The sickest desert group of all time”, Californian scene-setters Yawning Man are now, remarkably, in their 32nd year of existence. Latest album The Revolt Against Tired Noises (Heavy Psych Sounds) showcases the band’s talent to drift away with their adoring listeners across a dusty plain of companionship and innovation.  Opener ‘Black Kite’ is gorgeous, a grubby production allowing the wonderfully languid guitars to duel with a string section with all the ferocity of Dylan from the Magic Roundabout. It’s Haight Ashbury, it’s Woodstock, it’s the greatest trip a stoner groove has ever taken you on.\nThe title track invites Gary Arce’s delightfully jaunty leadwork to make up for a lack of words: no howling, but chiming and dancing through the powerful, emotional rhythmic swell. ‘Skyline Pressure’, meanwhile, reaffirms the links to hippy Americana with a light, pleasing air directed by Mario Lalli’s fat basslines and Bill Stinson’s huge drums which nevertheless remain the backseat drivers. As a result, the band’s sound is sometimes complex while remaining utterly bewitching. The ensuing ‘Grant’s Heart’ sees a rare vocal, from Lalli, and evokes comparison to Crosby Stills and Nash-style Country Folk: a pacier but delicate rhythm punctuated by more lush chords and dreamy harmonies. The intricate fretwork of ‘Violent Lights’ is dazzling but wistful, gently wailing, those drums a Prog thunder yet remaining in the distance.\nA delightful reworking of the band’s classic track ‘Catamaran’, made famous by worshippers Kyuss, is a lovely Summer breeze drifting through the languid smoke, blowing to a crushing chorus which is the heaviest thing on the album. ‘Misfortune Cookies’ showcases more of that emotive, trippy lead play which is the undoubted highlight here, but again the focus is never completely ripped away from a tight, booming rhythm section. This begins closer ‘Ghost Beach’ with a powerful, sparing drumbeat which maintains its structure for much of the track, whilst plaintive melodies have the paradoxical effect of lightening the air whilst giving the mood a poignant feel, the pulsating bridges howling a mournful elegy.\nStoner metal is a frequently maligned genre, oft being accused of tiredness and a lack of invention. Tell that to these guys. Despite advancing years the band’s sound is fresh, moving and insightful, creating joy and sadness with a wonderfully harmonised, chilled-out vibe. Full of charm and vitality, this is a beautiful return.\nReview by Paul Quinn http://www.ghostcultmag.com/album-review-yawning-man-the-revolt-against-tired-noises-heavy-psych-sounds/\n1.

Art As Catharsis is proud to release the debut self-titled record from Turtle Skull – a warm, full toned psychedelic record with a range of influences equally as colourful as their music.  Taking inspiration from Black Mountain, Sleep, King Gizzard and more, Turtle Skull’s finished product gives fresh direction to the Australian psych scene. Rolling low riffs, patterned bass lines, groaning guitar and counter-cultural lyrics merge over an exchange of dirty and smooth tracks – the final product satiating those hungry for both heavy grooves and thoughtful song writing.  It’s about layers and textures – closing your eyes and seeing how deep you can go, really getting in touch with each individual sound and movement. You can say so much with just one note or sound if you focus on the texture of it, the way it warbles, vibrates and oscillates. Ultimately it’s about mind expansion through music,\nEden, the first single from the record, is unashamed in its worship of fuzz. Running out the gates with a meaty hook before sliding into smooth, vocal driven grooves, Eden shifts through a kaleidoscope of riffs and shimmering textures before reeling you back with a consistent, thumping hook.  The end of the record leaves listeners at the end of a journey through political ideologies and light-hearted joy set to the backdrop of lush, buzzing soundscapes. Their live show is equally as climatic: a wall of fuzzed out riffs cascading against a lysergic sky, while dreamy, psych-pop vocals float over the void.\n1.  No News is Bad News - 0:00\n2.

            "description": "Da Captain Trips - Adventures in the Upside Down (Full Album).  Da Captain Trips are a jam band plying their trade out of Italy. They formed \"as a joke in 2009 by three overweight beardy friends\" - their words not mine! They are a band who can seem strangely overlooked by the psych community.  Da Captain Trips have always been a band not constrained by one single approach to music making, they incorporate many different styles, genres etc in their output making them always interesting and always worth checking out. 'Adventures In The Upside Down'  is no different - taking in psychedelia, Space Rock, Prog, krautrock and even surf and, all in all, a damn fine listen!\n'The Calm And The Storm' opens the album with a long, drawn out drone and some electronic effects before a lonesome guitar is heard over the drone - it's all very melancholic and sounding distinctly nautical, with a 'twanging' downbeat surfy vibe. The track opens up to become a motoring psych/space rock number with flashes of kosmische electronica under the guitar. 'Manta' has an intro that reminded me of the 'Knightrider' theme - random I know!. However, it immediately transforms into another chuggin' track with more than a hint of krautrock about it...so far, so great. 'Revelation' is something different altogether....the twang heard in the first track returns with vengeance...a trippy, surf vibe is built, like Jan and Dean on acid, broken only by passages of more cosmic electronica and jazzy psych with saxophone courtesy of Lee Relfe from Sendelica. It's a great track that leaves the listener wondering where things are going next.\n'Dear Zahdia' has a very retro feel about it, the vibe is very seventies with flashes of prog, mainly due to the organ sounding synth work. As the track travels it's course things become heavier and far more psych. 'Trespasses Bay - Peaceful Place' is the longest and most complex of the tracks. It has again that wonderful twang guitar giving it a surf feel and, like the previous track, it does have a proggy feel at times but in the main it is a slowburning, psychedelic meander, chocked full of atmosphere and plenty of reverb. The last section has some great electronica that once again takes us back to the seventies.\nThe album is brought to a close by 'Mother Earth'...starting with some bucolic guitar that is bordering on folk, it is an initially pastoral track that shows another side to the band - a side that is not afraid to eschew their psychedelic musings for something more introspective and contemplative... for a while at least..it blossoms into a superlative jam as it nears the end of it's ten minute length. 'Adventures In The Upside Down' is a great album, full of invention and wonder - taking different aspects of the 'psych' world and mixing them to form an album that is actually remarkably restful and evocative. It is still as trippy as hell in places but, maybe more than their other recordings, more reliant on technique and craft rather than all out jamfests.

They formed \"as a joke in 2009 by three overweight beardy friends\" - their words not mine! They are a band who can seem strangely overlooked by the psych community.  Da Captain Trips have always been a band not constrained by one single approach to music making, they incorporate many different styles, genres etc in their output making them always interesting and always worth checking out. 'Adventures In The Upside Down'  is no different - taking in psychedelia, Space Rock, Prog, krautrock and even surf and, all in all, a damn fine listen!",

            "description": "Largely through sheer force of will, Black Rainbows have become Italy’s foremost purveyors of heavy psychedelic rock. Pandaemonium is the sixth full-length from the Roman trio, and they’ve never sounded more driven or lysergic then they do in its nine-track/45-minute run. Led by guitarist/vocalist Gabriele Fiori, the three-piece run a colorful gamut of high-energy, sopping wet groove, and whether they’re in the maximum-fuzz thrust of “Riding Fast ‘Til the End of Time,” dug into the more threatening lumber of “Grindstone” or languidly making their way through the cosmos on album finale “13th Step of the Pyramid,” they burn and melt classic influences into something of their own; whether it’s culled from Sabbath, Fu Manchu, Nebula, Monster Magnet or Hawkwind, it doesn’t matter. It’s Black Rainbows.\nTone, as ever, is essential to what they do, and Fiori‘s is dead-on righteous in “The Sacrifice” but as Fiori and bassist Giuseppe Guglielmino welcome new drummer Filippo Ragazzoni, they seem to lock into an especially potent trio form. The longest tracks on Pandaemonium are the highlights and show this best, “Grindstone” moving fluidly from its initial lumbering to a tripped out spacious midsection, minimalist and topped with samples but tense and building its wash toward a crescendo that closes side A and offers one of the record’s most satisfying payoffs. With “Sunrise,” “High to Hell” and “The Sacrifice” before it, Black Rainbows shift deftly between catchy heavy rock songcraft and more expansive fare, eventually ceding the ground to the Wyndorfian strum of tracklisting centerpiece “Supernova and Asteroids,” which though it’s only a little over two minutes long, emphasizes just how important atmospherics have become as part of Black Rainbows‘ overarching methodology.\nThe wash of effects, near-constant swirl, and echo on Fiori‘s voice are, of course, appreciated, but it’s what Black Rainbows accomplish by varying their tempos, structures nnd overall scope that makes Pandaemonium succeed as it does. With vinyl in mind, it’s side A that shows this best with each song developing its own presence while feeding into the overarching groove of the record as a whole, and as it would in homage to the classic form, side B pushes the limits of the band’s aesthetic. After “Supernova and Asteroids,” the ultra-fuzzed “Riding Fast ‘Til the End of Time” takes hold with full-throttle forward motion, turning on a dime into the bridge and the chorus from itis decamatry verse, an extended solo section marked out by organ in the second half only adding to the sense of build throughout, the feeling that Black Rainbows have become experts at this kind of sonic gamesmanship.\nIt’s been a trip and in the end of “13th Step of the Pyramid,” the listener finally finds out where it’s all been leading.  The answer, of course, is “huge jam.” Fiori seems to layer rhythm and lead guitars for an even more packed arrangement, but it’s even more about the vibe the whole band creates in the process. Choice groove, an emergent standout riff, a final build, and residual effects swirl on a fade when they’ve cycled through the last measure. It’s a patient but still energetic finale, and it’s one worthy of the record preceding all the more because of the underlying sense of consciousness and purposefulness behind it.  Six albums deep and more than a decade into their career, it’s time to consider Black Rainbows masters of the form. Their heavy psych wants for nothing in spirit or sound, and their songwriting has never sounded more assured of its reach. As well it should be.\nReview from The Obelisk http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2018/04/03/black-rainbows-pandaemonium-review-stream/\n1.  Sunrise - 0:00\n2.  High To Hell - 5:07\n3.

            "description": "Floating is the new full length album from Mouth.  Mouth were formed in Cologne Germany in 2000 as a trio, comprised of Christian Koller (vocals, guitars, occasional keyboards), Gerald Kirsch (bass) and Nick Mavridis (drums, backing vocals, keyboards). Indeed, their style is often cited as a mixture of 'retro prog', Krautrock, hard rock, psyche and glam rock - all together it fuses into a unique spleen often underlined with dystopian themes.  Floating is the follow up to last year's Vortex.  Floating is by and large more psychedelically influenced; proto-progressive instead of classically progressive.\nAn outlier for sure, “Madbeth” almost reminds of something ’90s weirdos Ween would come up with, but even in that it remains decidedly progressive in its catchy, bizarre shuffle and sneering vocals. The subsequent organ-say-hello-to-wah drifter “Homagotago” — a Can reference? — comes across like an exploratory jam led by its layered in guitar solo, but clearly there’s a trajectory being followed. The mix of Floating‘s longest track is given depth through the organ and other backing synth, and bass and drums seem to hold together a progression that otherwise would simply melt into lysergic goo. Already in the first three tracks, Mouth have given three distinctly different vibes, but fortunately for anyone who might take the heady but not unwelcoming album on, their command over their sound is steady no matter where they head.\nCompletely instrumental, “Homagotago” is given a bit of funk bounce as it crossed its midpoint, but it doesn’t last, and instead the three-piece push through something of an understated crescendo and finish with the keys and synth sort of drifting off into the unknown. What I’ll assume is the side A closer, “Reversed” is more grounded in a proto-prog hook with layers of swirl backing its vibe-heavy naturalism and blend of acoustic and electric guitars, keys melded in with a tambourine and subtle, relaxed boogie. There’s something garage-style about Floating‘s affect overall, but it’s hard to pinpoint that in moments perhaps outside the pre-punk rhythm-making of “Madbeth” or perhaps “Distance” still to come, but it might just be in the record’s more concise presentation.\nSide B moves from “Sunrise” to closer “Sunset,” and in between, the shorter “Distance”  and “O.T.B. Field”  work respectively to add to the scope of Floating overall and revive its sense of movement ahead of “Sunset,” which follows.  “Distance” is of particular note, as it essentially breaks in hal just before about 90 seconds in, leaving its verse/chorus approach behind in favor of peaceful drone and acoustic interplay that’s drifting and immersive in kind until it cuts short into the boogie of “O.T.B. Field,” which like “Madbeth” before it feels wilful in its weirdness and more geared toward catchiness than some of the other material surrounding. The finale of Floating begins, suitably enough, with organ and guitar in back and forth conversation, and is soon enough backed by a funky drum beat similar to but perhaps not exactly the same as that which featured on “Sunrise.” At just under five minutes long, it builds in tempo and volume over its constant organ line until it just kind of comes apart and the drums announce its finish, cutting everything off cold.\nThe bookends on side B give Floating‘s second half the impression of being an album unto itself — as though the entire album were a 2LP condensed into a single platter.  As it turns out, Floating was put together over the course of three years of recording between 2012 and 2015, so it’s hard to say what it stands for in terms of the overarching growth of the band, but Mouth have used these manifestations of disparate songwriting impulses to conjure a sense of wholeness and realization that makes Floating work well as a singular entity.  Does that mean they’ll have another record out in 2019? I have no idea whatsoever, but if they’re as committed to momentum as they seem to be — which is particularly fascinating given that they were founded in 2000, didn’t release their first album until 2009 and didn’t follow that up until last year — then anything’s possible and they make it fun to imagine where they might take their sound next, forward or backward in time, or perhaps out of it entirely.\nReview from The Obelisk http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2018/03/20/mouth-floating-review-stream/\n1.

            "summary": "Floating is the new full length album from Mouth.  Mouth were formed in Cologne Germany in 2000 as a trio, comprised of Christian Koller (vocals, guitars, occasional keyboards), Gerald Kirsch (bass) and Nick Mavridis (drums, backing vocals, keyboards). Indeed, their style is often cited as a mixture of 'retro prog', Krautrock, hard rock, psyche and glam rock - all together it fuses into a unique spleen often underlined with dystopian themes.  Floating is the follow up to last year's Vortex.  Floating is by and large more psychedelically influenced; proto-progressive instead of classically progressive.",

            "description": "Full album stream plus film of Zeitgeber's Heteronomy.  Zeitgeber's Heteronomy is an exploration of psychedelic, ambient, world and electronic music. You’ll hear hints of Balkan and African rhythms, washes of reverb-soaked textures, and instrumentation as eclectic as ‘caisa’ handpan, clarinet, didgeridoo, ‘sansula’ thumb piano, melodica, guitar and viola.  Conceptually the album is a homage to the hidden forces and environmental stimuli that regulate and modulate human behaviour and psychology - like a zeitgeber, a rhythmically occurring natural phenomenon which acts as a cue in the regulation of the body's circadian rhythms.\nHeteronomy is the Sydney, Australia duo's debut release.  On Heteronomy the polyrhythmic electro world grooves on display wade through the band’s deep fascination with the deep inner workings of the human mind from a spiritual perspective. The album is strewn with fascinating references to spirituality and the mechanics of perception itself and the music is just bullshit cool.  Throughout the release you’ll hear multiple acoustic and electric sounds blend and pop in and out to create a truly broad array of sounds, the way the sounds blend is done in such a considered way in that acoustic sources (like the Kalimba on the track ‘Circadian Rhythms’) are so well processed with washy verbs and stuff that they integrate seamlessly with everything else. Where this becomes really enjoyable is in assuming that, this band clearly has a lot of tricks up their sleeve, and something that might seem on surface level to be quite simple is actually bafflingly intricate in its textural arrangement.\nComplimenting that is the rhythmic component that creates the backbone of truly dazzling moments in this album. It’s so so hard to describe the feeling that comes with the rhythmic component being so prominent and so complex in this realm of music, it’s just a cathartic wash, it’s like it disables a part of the brain that is so affixed to driving rawk drum bullshit (even outside of band genres), the interplay between each instrument rhythmically is to my ears just so enveloping, it’s like hearing a master ambient maker at work.  Heteronomy is a unique and engrossing listen that will please fans of Dawn Of Midi, Manu Delago’s Living Room, Portico Quartet, Estradasphere, and anyone interested in the fusion of music from across the globe.\nReview by Anthony Cooley http://echoesanddust.com/2017/04/zeitgeber-heteronomy/\n1.

The deep, slappy bass line rumbles against a proto-tinged psychedelic flair with shades of acidic 70s underground. Riffs baked with sun fried fuzz distort above the land called ‘Warsaw’ as a disturbingly pleasant groove fills the stage with a killer Polish accent.  The way the clean guitar intro to Checkered Room kicks into some heavy fuzz and groove grabbed my attention and by the time I heard the intro to Snow, via the Graveyard meets 1000mods boogie of Kwiat Paproci, I knew there was something special going on here. All killer, no filler right up to the epic finale Endless Rift. Don't hang around. Buy this now!\nReview by Bucky Brown and Jonny Pirie\n1.  Checkered Room - 0:00\n2.  Kwiat Paproci - 5:18\n3.

            "description": "Mouth - Vortex (Full Album) Mouth were formed in Cologne in 2000.  The Mouth's style is a blend of 'golden era' progressive rock - with influential names such are Yes, Genesis, Gentle Giant, Soft Machine, as well as classic rock/hard rock and prog related names old and new.  Indeed, their style is often cited as a mixture of 'retro prog', Krautrock, hard rock, psyche and glam rock - all together it fuses into a unique spleen often underlined with dystopian themes.   Some eight years after releasing their debut, Rhizome, and 17 years after first getting together in 2000, German progressive classicists Mouth offer their second full-length in the form of Vortex. An album that winks its ’70s influences even unto its cover art, it finds the three-piece of vocalist/guitarist/keyboardist Chris Koller, bassist Gerald Kirsch and drummer/keyboardist Nick Mavridis nestled easily and immediately into headphone-ready krautrock vibes that continue to spread out across the 56-minute release, which arrives bookended by two 16-minute tracks in opener “Vortex” and closer “Epilogue.”\nKing Crimson, Pink Floyd, Uriah Heep, Brainticket, Hawkwind, and so on, are of course reference points as they invariably would be, but like US-based outfit Eye, Mouth distinguish themselves through the fluidity of their composition — that opener arrives in four parts: “To the Centre,” “Turbulence,” “Silence” and “Vortex” itself — through creative arrangements of guitar around various key instruments and vintage-sounding synth, and through the overarching poise of their delivery.  Neither does Vortex lack drive, and even as “Vortex”  also the longest track — carries through the organ-soaked/lead-topped swirl of its “Silence” portion with spoken vocals behind its instrumental build, Mouth hold to a firm sense of forward direction and don’t simply meander to suit their own whims. And after all that cascading, the eponymous portion of “Vortex” caps with ambient synth, acoustic strum and far-back layers of electric guitar in what comes across very much as a final movement, so there’s a feeling of completeness to Vortex that, informed by the extended opener, continues throughout the proceedings that follow.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, one finds “Epilogue,” the corresponding finale that nearly matches the opener for runtime. It’s a slowly unfolding, three-stage (mostly) instrumental jam, languid and hypnotic, that gives way to silence after three and 12 minutes and finally leads to a sitar-infused hidden track of organ-laced psychedelia. Arguably the most intentionally molten stretch of Vortex, “Epilogue” is ultimately just that: the afterword from Mouth‘s long-form statement, and while when considering the launch and the landing, Vortex is already a considerable achievement in classic prog, there’s still significant stylistic expression happening in its journey through shorter tracks “March of the Cyclopes”, “Parade”, the centerpiece “Mountain”, “Into the Light” and “Soon After…”, as the three-piece set to balancing their impulses toward willful complexity and cosmic psychedelia.\nReview from The Obelisk http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2017/06/19/mouth-vortex-review-stream-1/\n1.

            "description": "Brother O' Brother - Neon Native (Full Album) Brother O’ Brother is a band from Indiana. There are two guys in the band: Chris Banta and Warner Swopes. Banta plays guitar and handles the vocals, while Swopes sits in the pocket. They’ve got a full-length album – 12 songs – dropping in May, called Neon Native.  Essentially, Brother O’ Brother is a garage band with dense influences of blues and gospel. I know, I know, gospel rock sounds like an oxymoron, but in this case is it full-spectrum dominance, like vampires breeding with werewolves, a muscular graft-job. Excellent stuff!  Initially, I couldn’t put my finger on what Brother O’ Brother’s music reminded me of. And then it hit me – Jimi Hendrix marries AC DC: their offspring is Brother O’ Brother.\nThere’s an indefinable element, a pulverizing rawness that prompts such an analogy. There’s a stochastic resonance to Brother O’ Brother’s sound that’s assertive and visceral, like a kick in the stomach.  These guys have got it going on.  Banta’s guitar work resembles corrosive particle winds from a galactic storm. Lots of fuzz buster that provides a layered sound: big, with a sensual, more alive than alive quality. His guitar, along with his vocals, really steer the music. The vocals – cool and proto-punk – demand special attention. Banta’s voice comes across as wickedly noxious and robust, like a potent cigar that’s too damn strong to smoke without turning green. In other words, the dude can belt it out.  Like most good drummers, Swopes hits hard and extends the sound of the snare, which gives the music a crazy, irresponsible ferocity. Drummers never receive much attention, but Swopes takes care of business like a gaudy old whore at a teamsters convention.\nHighlights include “R.O.S.E.”, “16 Flowers,” which begins with a Jimmy Page-like guitar riff, along with “I Got It,” which has a vicious punk flavor hidden inside. And, of course, “Widow Maker,” upon which Swopes makes the cymbals hiss like a pit full of vipers.  You need to check these guys out. Pick up a copy of Neon Native. If you don’t, you’ll be sorry.\nReview by Randy Radic http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/58d2a938e4b062043ad4af00\n1. R.O.S.E - 0:00\n2. 16 Flowers - 4:55\n3. Sunshine - 8:59\n4.

            "description": "Black Willows - Haze (Full Album) Self-released in a six-panel foldout digipak that includes a poster, the debut album from Swiss foursome Black Willows strikes an immediately curious impression. Haze reaches upwards of 70 minutes and finds its crux in sometimes-droning psychedelic repetitions, slowed down space rock and periodic bouts of riffnosis.  By the time Haze has started, past the buzzing noise of the two-minute title-track intro, it’s readily apparent that the band will be taking their time. Since usually this kind of thing comes coated in greens, yellows, reds and oranges, it’s something of a surprise Black Willows didn’t go total-spectrum in the layout. The greyscale gives Haze — which was recorded in the sunny clime of Austin, TX — an individual edge before you even press play.  Perhaps that’s the point — it’s what everyone else does, so they did the opposite — but either way, there’s a moody underpinning for the echoing vocals of “Doors of Perception” as a result, some Dead Meadow shoegaze meeting heavy psych jam payoffs in slowed down subspace.\nThe dual guitars of Mélanie Renaud and Aleister Crowley move the songs forward by and large, giving the latter’s vocals plenty of room to echo out, but as “Neptune” takes hold with a more nodding thud, the rumble work of bassist Kevin Richard and particularly the languid punctuation of drummer Nicolas Monica are shown for the essential pieces they are. “Neptune” is the first of four songs in a row — followed by “Haiku,” “Black Magic” and “Apache” — that top eight minutes apiece, and though they vary in mood, with “Haiku” reminding in its instrumental stretches of some of the tension Elder created on their Dead Roots Stirring long-player while the more contemplative “Black Magic” touches on Easternisms in its drone and “Apache” delves into revival of the it’s-a-nod-scene-baby groove of “Neptune” en route to squibbly explorations and noisy climax, it remains a lot to take in one sitting.\nYet Haze doesn’t really work any other way. Nothing with a flow as consistent or as engaging as that which Black Willows concoct over the course of these songs is meant to be taken one song at a time. It would be sacrilege, and not the good kind. And yet, so sit and pick apart every move each song is making during a complete-album listen misses the point, which is to let yourself be taken by the aforementioned flow — they position it thusly, “…the user may experience anything from subtle changes in perception to overwhelming cognitive shifts” — and allow the songs to wash over a willing subconscious. So song-by-songing isn’t the thing, and what Haze really requires is a careful balance of consciousness and unconsciousness — but even more than that, it requires space to breathe and run its extended course.\n“Velvet Diamond” continues the laid-back exploratory feel as verses give way to repeat-repeat jamming that patiently enacts a build, but just when it seems like the track is going to hit its apex, it hits right into the intro of the following “Set Us Free,” essentially starting over from scratch. These ebbs and flows only really stand out if you’re paying (too) close attention, and after about two and a half-minutes, the guitars stand alone joined in a quick lead line announcing the arrival of the droning verse, some Om-style vibe pervading not so much in the vocals as in the riff itself, which again is kept directed by Monica‘s drumming, slow fills giving enough edge to the riffs that they almost seem to be in motion. Putting Haze over the top is the 14:37 closer “Dead Mantra,” basically an album unto itself with from-silence-to-chaos jumps and intertwining guitar lines that only add to the wash, again vaguely reminiscent of some of Elder‘s latter day progressions when it hits its loudest. Black Willows should have no trouble implanting themselves in the cortex of the underground, remaining there for the duration and leaving a positive impression when it decides to move on to the next lobe.\nReview from The Obelisk http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2013/08/02/black-willows-haze-review/\n1.

            "description": "Brother O' Brother - Show Pony (Full Album) Hailing from Indianapolis, Chris Banta and Warner Swopes of Brother O’ Brother deal in raw, rootsy blues rock that has an almost religious fervor.  Brother O’ Brother are for real and their sophomore long player, Show Pony, is filled with energy, garage blues and never ending rock n roll. Those three ingredients are exactly what it takes Brother O’ Brother to make a good record. I could care less that the territory covered on Show Pony has been traveled before but that Chris Banta’s vocals and guitar with Warner Swopes’ drums bring down the house. Not only do they give 110% throughout Show Pony but they supply plenty of diverse thoughts to keep Show Pony’s 10 tracks vibrant for its entire 35 minute running time.\nFrom Show Pony‘s opening track The Itch, you will hear all of the indie-garage-blues-rock ingredients that’s found in nearly all records of the sub genre, but the big difference being here is authenticity. While bands like The Black Keys are going through a check list of things they have to employ to stay relevant among their target audience, like ‘must have the skinniest jeans’ or ‘must hate every other indie-blues-rock band’, Brother O’ Brother is focused on what’s important to each song on the set list, and delivering on all accounts.  Even though there is plenty of the proverbial chunky pentatonic guitar riffs, and kick heavy beats throughout the record, it’s met with a handful of other influences such as the free-form poise of Jimi Hendrix to the artistic vulnerability of Beck, maybe even a hint of skate punk, like in the song Blood & Cigarettes. With a palette of scattered influences across the board, paired with standard features, Brother O’ Brother still manage to come as a breath of fresh air.\nThe entire album is straight to the point with no down time whatsoever. Clocking in at just under 35 minutes, there isn’t much room for any filler or padding. That’s the sign of a good album when it makes you beg for more. The entire record plays like a set list of an opening act who know they are far greater than the band they are opening for, and prove it by ripping through their catalog at a hungry, make-or-break speed, going for broke.  The explosive full on pulsing rock that erupts during “White Dove” between verses is invigorating while the band also can show restraint like on “Heavy Stone,” as the guitar simmers as the woo hoos float in the background. You think the song will rocket off but instead it coolly keeps its composure. There are some other surprises on Show Pony as well, such as the under three minute punk out rocker “Blood & Cigarettes,” the thunderous rain of instruments that pour down on the title track and the slow grinding closer titled “Shelter.”\nI will proudly report that there is not one new thing to be found on Show Pony. It is a blues garage rock record that wears everything on its sleeve and leaves it all at your speakers’ woofers. The key is that Brother O’ Brother never lets up off the pedal and Show Pony is the summer ride you have been waiting for. All you really need to do is just open the door and let these nice Indiana boys in!  Overall Show Pony is one of the finest rock records of 2015 and maybe one the best indie blues rock albums to be released in over a decade, in a genre that loses it’s excitement with every beer commercial. Brother O Brother is a band that I know we will see around for quite a while.\nReview by Aaron The Audiophile and Christopher Anthony http://www.50thirdand3rd.com/review-brother-o-brother-show-pony/\nhttps://thefirenote.com/2015/08/13/brother-o-brother-show-pony-album-review/\n1.

            "description": "Stonerror - Stonerror (Full Album) Stonerror pushed all the right buttons with the release of their debut EP \"Rattlesnake Moan\".  The band, Jarosław Daniel - guitar , Jacek Malczewski - bass, Łukasz Mazur - vocals and Maciej Ołownia - drums, have now delivered on the potential shown on that EP with the release of their first full length album \"Stonerror\".  Those raw edges found on \"Rattlesnake Moan\" have on \"Stonerror\" been sanded down a touch but have been done so without compromising any of the edgy grittiness that made that EP such joyous and essential listen for those fans of the stoner/desert persuasion. The Kyuss/QOTSA - like grooves, that were an integral part of the bands sound on the debut EP, are still there in abundance but are tempered with elements of psych, blues, alt/grunge and old school hard rock textures. combining to give the album a far more interesting and diverse feel.\nSongs like \"Red Tank\", \"Misbegotten\" and \"The Wolf\" continue the bands tradition of jamming dusty desert grooves coated in clean melodic vocals over hard driven rhythms but it is when the band step outside of the restraints of their desert/stoner roots that things start to get really interesting. On   \"Los Hermanos\" the band experiment with elements of mood and atmosphere utilizing a slow burning Colour Haze-esque groove over which hushed ,almost whispered, vocals are delivered, the song undulating between quiet passages of eerie otherworldliness and heavy stoner groove before finally finishing on a lone guitar motif and fading to silence.Not content with this the band even throw a little folky coloring into the mix with the delightfully sublime and eclectic \"The Ride\" pouring Wishbone Ash -like vocal melodies over a mix of acoustic and electric grooviness.\nThe psych drenched final track \"Blues for the Red Sea\" sees Stonerror exploring their lysergic side, the bands initial stoner/desert groove, populated with driving rhythms and reverb soaked vocals, suddenly taking off into full on instrumental mode with swirling Hawkwind-esque keyboard effects swooping back and forth over a  backdrop of tumultuous drumming, boneshaking bass and acid tainted guitar colouring before finishing on a wave of  glorious swirling, swooping noise.  \"Rattlesnake Moan\" was an EP made by a band trying to find their feet in a scene populated by giants, \"Stonerror\" sees that band standing on those feet and now staring those giants square in the eye.\nReview by Frazer Jones http://stonerking1.blogspot.com/2017/02/stonerror-stonerror-review.html\n1.

The band, Jarosław Daniel - guitar , Jacek Malczewski - bass, Łukasz Mazur - vocals and Maciej Ołownia - drums, have now delivered on the potential shown on that EP with the release of their first full length album \"Stonerror\".  Those raw edges found on \"Rattlesnake Moan\" have on \"Stonerror\" been sanded down a touch but have been done so without compromising any of the edgy grittiness that made that EP such joyous and essential listen for those fans of the stoner/desert persuasion. The Kyuss/QOTSA - like grooves, that were an integral part of the bands sound on the debut EP, are still there in abundance but are tempered with elements of psych, blues, alt/grunge and old school hard rock textures. combining to give the album a far more interesting and diverse feel.",

            "description": "The Clamps - Blend, Shake, Swallow (Full Album) The Clamps are a three-piece speed-stoner rock n' roll band formed in northern Italy around 2012. Made up by former members of local punk, metal and alternative rock bands.  The Clamps squeeze stoner, speed-rock, punk and rock n'roll into a well-recognizable, no-frills, fat and fuzzy sound. Their live shows are pure energy. The debut album Deadly Kick For A Fat Fucker was released in 2013. The second album Blend, Shake, Swallow is made of eleven speed-rock n' roll super tracks. The album is fast, the production is high quality. It's the perfect soundtrack for a fast and furious car journey on the highway to hell! There's a pinch of punk n' toll too that makes the album tracks much more groovy and dirty. Their sound will destroy your face once you push the start button.\nThe 11 tracks here claim they are perfect “for a fast and furious car journey to hell”. There isn’t much we can add to that here except to say that if that trip was a kamikaze mission to take on Beelzebub himself then that description would be somewhere close.  “Blend Shake Swallow” begins and ends with a riotous instrumental, “Barracuda”, in between it is packed full of all kinds of tasty noise. “Liar” adds a piano lick and sounds like The Hellacopters” after a shit load of E Numbers, “Must Destroy” boasts a hook that suggests “don’t look in the past” and this is uttered with all the conviction that MV would really advise against it.  Elsewhere “Get Ready Now” is a high-speed into the self-explanatory, and “Fake And Blind” is a snotty, potty mouthed piece of gloriousness that is somewhere between Motorhead, Backyard Babies and Bonafide, and by the time its soaring chorus has hit, then frankly you would happily give The Clamps the deeds to your house if they asked.\nIt could be argued that “…..Swallow” is a bit of a one trick pony, but that doesn’t matter, when the magic is good as here, “Nacho Vidal” packs more fun than should be allowed into less than four minutes, and “In My Head” poses the very real question of: would you like to even know what happens there?  Like driving a wrecking ball into a model village, there is no escape here. “Dirty Little Girl” is as viscous as you’d expect it to be, and although “Enjoy The Ride” implores you to do just that, then you’d do so at your own risk as who knows what you’d catch?  The last proper track “One More Time” is slower with more groove and hints of an almost stoner intention, but even here they infuse it with something that is like a Peter Pan Speedrock jamming with Zeke just for the hell of it.  “Blend Shake Swallow” is perfect for one of those “new year, new you” bags of bullshit. Low calorie, because they’ve trimmed all the fat off,  and its a damn sight more fun than a trip to the Gym. This is purely and simply downright glorious.\nReview by Andy Thorley and Forced Exposure http://www.maximumvolumemusic.com/review-clamps-blend-shake-swallow-2017/\nhttp://www.forcedexposure.com/Catalog/clamps-the-blend-shake-swallow-cd/HPS.047CD.html\n1.

            "description": "Hey Satan - Hey Satan (Full Album) Hey Satan is a Stoner Rock band with something different about them. This is a band that blends moments of Classic Rock, Desert Rock and Psych for a heavy and interesting sound of their own. You can tell that the band have been influenced by bands such as Kyuss, QOTSA and Led Zeppelin.  Opening track – Fallon City Messiah – is perhaps named after a certain individual that we all know and love. The song does have a Clutch style vibe with the delivery of both the vocals and riffs. Though those initial feelings start to disappear as the song progresses. Heavy Blues Rock spliced with Desert/Stoner Rock that see Hey Satan play with huge confidence. An almost perfect combination of classic stadium rock swagger and modern sounding Stoner sounds.\nLegal Aspect Of Love – has a vintage QOTSA feel to it then it explodes with huge blasts of Stoner Rock/Metal riffs that you don’t really expect. The lyrics have quite a playful and humorous feel to them that matches the crazy instrumental work the band are currently playing. Sunshine Blues – is a more straightforward Stoner Rock track with the band playing heavy slow-paced riffs at the start before the heavier moments appear. The vocals by Insert Name Later are cool, focused and precise. The music is once again influenced by the more familiar sounds of Desert/Stoner Rock scene. Hey Satan does inject some much needed creativity along the way.  In Cold Blood – is one of the standout songs on the album. As the band play a more direct style of Psychedelic Stoner Rock with superb instrumental work that demands your full attention. The screeching guitars towards the end add a sense of chaos with the band still in full control of their music.\n1991 – sees the band add a thunderous dash of Blues Rock with the music deciding if it wants to be a seventies sounding loud rock anthem or a modern day sounding stoner rock/metal sing-along. The song finds the right balance between the two different styles of music.  It seems that Hey Satan wanted to create the loudest album they possibly could without them venturing into the world of heavy metal. They succeed on all counts as this is a very loud album from start to finish. Other great tracks to check out are Song For A Lost Mariner, Black Flags Down and Bastardizer.  Hey Satan’s self titled debut album is a celebration of all things HEAVY and LOUD. The production is first rate. All in all, Hey Satan have delivered a brilliantly entertaining debut album that is packed full of anthemic songs. This is one album you’ll be playing over and over again.\nReview by Steve Howe at Outlaws Of The Sun http://outlawsofthesun.blogspot.com/2017/01/hey-satan-st-album-review.html\n1.

            "summary": "Hey Satan - Hey Satan (Full Album) Hey Satan is a Stoner Rock band with something different about them. This is a band that blends moments of Classic Rock, Desert Rock and Psych for a heavy and interesting sound of their own. You can tell that the band have been influenced by bands such as Kyuss, QOTSA and Led Zeppelin.  Opening track – Fallon City Messiah – is perhaps named after a certain individual that we all know and love. The song does have a Clutch style vibe with the delivery of both the vocals and riffs. Though those initial feelings start to disappear as the song progresses. Heavy Blues Rock spliced with Desert/Stoner Rock that see Hey Satan play with huge confidence. An almost perfect combination of classic stadium rock swagger and modern sounding Stoner sounds.",

            "description": "Cloud - Indeterminate (Full Album) Remember \"Unpolished\" from Clouds 2015 EP? Well the first title track on Indeterminate takes you down memory lane... only this time with brutal force! The thunderous acoustic journey takes you to a wide open crunchy landscape where the riffs electrify for an in your face doom party! This song is mean! Climaxing to a dark atmospheric world and finally grounding you and sending you on your way home as the song ends. Track 2, Relapse, well let's just say it's the CLOUD we all remember. Bringing us back to similar sounds from the bands first EP. The guitar work on this song is some kind of genius. Riff after riff after sonic tube driven riff! This one will keep you coming back for that \"One last hit, I swear\". And if you think it couldn't get any better, you my friend are dead wrong! Track 3, Desert Weed, featuring guest vocals from the front man of the Argentina based doom trio Mephistofeles. This collaboration will surely have you packing that bong with the finest sea of green.\nPowerful riffs, punchy bass, and an all around classic stoner rock vibe. Take a ride, turn it up, and hot box the shit out of your moms mini van! Otherworldly is the fourth track on \"Indeterminate\". This song doesn't keep you waiting. Straight out the gate with more of that stoner rock we love. A very straight forward approach that winds down to a thick build up that lifts your spirit into a mind bending \"other world\". It doesn't stop there... the midway point of this journey will keep you banging your head as the power trio unleashes one of the heaviest riffs we hear on the album. Still. Doesnt. Stop. Progressively taking you deeper into this strange world, Cloud finishes you off with a bridge that will be remembered and finally a euphoric end of travels.  And last but not least, the finale.. For those of you that need to brush up on your Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is the sacred \"ash tree\" that extends into the 9 different worlds. The opening riff says it all. Leading you into a very bass heavy, atmospheric bridge. A bridge to one of the 9 worlds? Either way, we're going somewhere! This jam extends into a full throttle journey into the world of riffage and finally ending with a doom explosion that will leave a mess in your pants. Let's face it. Indeterminate is a solid release from front to back!!!!\nReview from Marty M. Joyner @ The Doom Press\n1.  Indeterminate - 0:00\n2.  Relapse - 10:48\n3.  Desert Weed - 17:40\n4.

            "summary": "Cloud - Indeterminate (Full Album) Remember \"Unpolished\" from Clouds 2015 EP? Well the first title track on Indeterminate takes you down memory lane... only this time with brutal force! The thunderous acoustic journey takes you to a wide open crunchy landscape where the riffs electrify for an in your face doom party! This song is mean! Climaxing to a dark atmospheric world and finally grounding you and sending you on your way home as the song ends. Track 2, Relapse, well let's just say it's the CLOUD we all remember. Bringing us back to similar sounds from the bands first EP. The guitar work on this song is some kind of genius. Riff after riff after sonic tube driven riff! This one will keep you coming back for that \"One last hit, I swear\". And if you think it couldn't get any better, you my friend are dead wrong! Track 3, Desert Weed, featuring guest vocals from the front man of the Argentina based doom trio Mephistofeles. This collaboration will surely have you packing that bong with the finest sea of green.",

            "description": "Mountainwolf are a trio out of  Annapolis, MD,  Chris Gipple (bass), Thomas Coster (drums) and Tyler Vaillant (guitar, vocals).  The Silk Road is their debut full length released in June 2015.  The Silk Road blends together 70's heavy rock with 80's alt/grunge, throws in a little doom, a smattering of psych and whole lot of Mountainwolf.  Absolutely paralyzing riffs! Slow enough for fans of uber-doom and loaded with mind bending groove and melodically grungy croons sure to please the more rock and roll oriented. Has a very Lo Pan'y sound but injected with enough hallucinogenics to send you spiraling on a trip to outer space on a rusted chard of heavy metal.\nThe album kicks off with \"The Jam\" five minutes and four seconds of  stoner excellence incorporating loud quiet loud grunge dynamics, gritty  stoner riffage and moments of psychedelic subtlety.  \"Wine x Weed\" utilizes a dirty fuzzed up doomy riff  around a low key, mournful vocal that then descends into spacey atmospherics with Vailllant using a ton of effects to create a lysergic, cosmic mood while Gipple and Coster hold it all together underneath until it all kicks off again at the end.  \"LSD\" is one of the stand out tracks on the album with it's phased guitar riff repeating over and around a delicious vocal. Vaillant pulls out his best solo on the album here, slightly Iommi-esque and with plenty of bluesy feel.  \"Mountainwolf\" sees the band nod their heads towards \"Pearl Jam\" with a track that would not have sounded out of place on that bands album \"Ten\".\n\"Via Amorosa\" is a nice little groover that goes from grungy doom into cosmic madness in the final third.  \"Hyphy Blues\" is an all out rocker with a totally infectious guitar lick that sits over the main riff.  Closer \"Via Dante\" almost topples \"LSD\" for best track status, full of moody atmospheric psych and acid blues guitar pyrotechnics.  Overall The Silk Road is one mind numbing, skull crushing debut from a band that shows amazing promise for the future.  Get the album today, your neighbors will thank you.\n1.  The Jam - 0:00\n2.

The Silk Road is their debut full length released in June 2015.  The Silk Road blends together 70's heavy rock with 80's alt/grunge, throws in a little doom, a smattering of psych and whole lot of Mountainwolf.  Absolutely paralyzing riffs! Slow enough for fans of uber-doom and loaded with mind bending groove and melodically grungy croons sure to please the more rock and roll oriented. Has a very Lo Pan'y sound but injected with enough hallucinogenics to send you spiraling on a trip to outer space on a rusted chard of heavy metal.",

            "description": "Black Rainbows - Stellar Prophecy (Full Album) With each new release, Roman outfit Black Rainbows continue to push themselves further and further into new ground between heavy psychedelia and fuzz rock. Each offering has been a marked step forward from the last. With Stellar Prophecy, their fifth LP — second through guitarist/vocalist Gabriele Fiori‘s Heavy Psych Sounds imprint — they have clearly figured out their sonic intent, but they brush past last year’s Hawkdope  in terms of refining their melting pot of heavy ’70s vibes, lysergic space worship, and forward-driving fuzz.  It’s been nine years since they issued their 2007 debut, Twilight of the Desert, and the strides they’ve made sonically and in their ambassadorship of bringing heavy rock to the people of Italy and bringing Italian heavy rock to the wider European scene, both on tour and in Fiori‘s work with the label, is simply unmatched.\nBlack Rainbows have demonstrated admirable creative will and energy, as well as a near-unmatched work ethic that shows itself in everything they do, including the quick turnaround between Hawkdope and this new collection. Stellar Prophecy comprises seven tracks and just under 44 vinyl-ready minutes of what has particularly over the last four years become their brand of upbeat, full-thrust heavy psych rock, still working from root influences like Nebula and Hawkwind, but having long since developed their own attitude and take on those influences.\nThe production on this release is just perfect. The drums lurk just under the surface of the mix, and are brilliantly solid and warm. The guitars and bass are like layers of an onion, stacked upon one another to create a larger mass that when coupled with the swirling, psychedelic lead lines and synths create an almost globe of trippy sound all the way around your brain. The vocals add to this effect and are creatively panned with heaps of delay, again layered to what seems like infinity.  The tracks are ordered brilliantly and just as you begin to drift off in your own little world, accompanied by the psychedelic almost meditational-like longer tracks, you’re pulled back into reality with huge catchy riffs. The album itself is around fourty-four minutes long but it feels like half that and you’ll find yourself spinning this one over and over again.\nElectrify and Woman are both tracks which get you into the mood, provide you with and introduction to the band’s sound and both rock out in their own way.  What they don’t do is have the intensity of ‘Golden Widow’.  This is a huge, sprawling and magnificent psych-blues-rock track which locks you into its groove early on and does not let go until the very end. This is Black Rainbows at their very best.  This intensity is kept up with the, much shorter, Evil Snake.  The heaviest track on the album, this is a real ‘rock out with your cock out’ track which has all you need in about three and a half minutes to satisfy even the most hard to please rock fan. The riffs are immense, the drums huge and the bass solid and throbbing.  After that Time To Die is anthemic and bluesy, while Keep The Secret will have you nodding your head remembering the great rock bands of yore. The album ends on a high with The Travel, a journey into space rock that is closest to the band’s regular Hawkwind credentials.\nStellar Prophecy is another superb album to add to your Black Rainbows collection. The band has changed their sound in so many different ways on this album as they have a more epic feel to their music. Everything about this album oozes class. What more do you expect from one of Italy’s finest Psych/Stoner Metal bands. Stellar Prophecy could be the bands most defining album to date.  Stellar Prophecy is another perfect slice of sun-drenched, desert fuzz goodness. If Monster Magnet, Fu Manchu, Wolfmother and Hawkwind all drove together down a dusty highway, this would be in the tape deck.  To be blunt about it, Stellar Prophecy is the most accomplished Black Rainbows yet. As they continue to mature, their work only becomes more and more satisfying.\n1. Electrify - 0:00\n2. Woman - 4:01\n3. Golden Widow - 9:43\n4. Evil Snake - 21:20\n5. It's Time to Die - 24:50\n6. Keep the Secret - 28:47\n7.

Druid is Kaleb Shaffner (guitar), Max Schmitz (bass), and Adam Mayhall (drums).  Druid return with something a little special, a little exciting and a whole lot magical!  Odysseus is their brand new album, released March 27th, 2016.  Odysseus features 5 cuts that masterfully mix elements of Doom/Stoner/Psychedelic/Blues with 70's style.  Odysseus is a worthy follow up to their self titled debut in every way!  Great things are ahead from one of the most promising up and coming bands in the Stoner sub genre.   The new Druid will not disappoint, that's for sure. They're growing without forsaking anything that's drawn people to them before, and you can't ask for more than that.",

            "description": "Duel - Fears Of The Dead (Full Album) Duel is a heavy Psychedelic Stoner Doom band from Austin, Texas. Largely influenced by the darker sounds of early 70’s Proto-metal. Features two ex Scorpion Child members. Their sound is menacing and brutally old school. Total purists, their tunes cut right to the bone with heavy, deep groove and blistering tone. Tough and Loud! Hard rock as it should be!  Let’s go ahead and judge Duel by the cover of their debut album “Fears of the Dead.” The background is red, The Grim Reaper stares off into the distance, and the band’s name is written in a font common for horror movies. My guess is that this Austin, Texas four piece has been raised on a steady diet of slasher films and Danzig. And what do you know, that’s exactly what we get to hear.\nWhat makes these horror-doom rockers so interesting to listen to is the general good times they’re serving up. The lyrics are dark, yes, but the palm muted riffs that explode into infectious choruses turn each song into a celebration. Such is the case with how “This Old Crow” bounces around between rollicking guitar riffs, simple lyrics, and a crisp snap of the snare drum. And when singer Tom Frank sings “it’s time to release the kraken!” in the stage-ready third cut, all fists in attendance will fight gravity and start punching at the sky. In short, Side A has you running to your turn table and placing the needle back at the beginning to go through all of this one more time.\nFeel free to do that but let us not forget that where there’s a Side A, there’s also a Side B. It’s on this side that the burl makes way for cleaner melodies. Opener “On the Edge” offers up a taste of some quality proto-punk which is balanced by the doomier 8 minute closer “Locked In.”  Between these two songs lies a homegrown bluesy shuffle in “Electricity,” a song that really takes the cake once Tom Frank hits his higher register in the chorus. “When the Pigs are Fed” is a cut that drips 1970’s classic rock and again uses the snappy snare drum to drive the chorus. Once “Locked In” closes out the record it’s hard to believe these 38 entertaining minutes of horror-doom and good time rock n’ roll have already passed us by.\n1.  Fears of the Dead - 0:00\n2.  This Old Crow - 5:50\n3.  The Kraken - 9:32\n4.  Fell to the Earth - 14:22\n5.  On the Edge - 18:50\n6.  Electricity - 22:06\n7.  When the Pigs Are Fed - 26:11\n8.

            "description": "Palm Desert - Pearls From The Muddy Hollow (Full Album) Perhaps unsurprising when one considers they take their name from the hometown of California’s ’90s desert rock movement, but Poland’s Palm Desert owe a large sonic debt to Kyuss. In the four-piece’s style of riffing, tonality and propensity for the occasional stoner jam on their third album, Pearls from the Muddy Hollow, they show their allegiance to the desert style and its blend of fuzzed-up punk and laid back psychedelia.  Vocalist Wojciech Gauszka helps change things up, however, with some elements of Soundgarden-era Chris Cornell to go with periodic John Garcia gruffness, so that Pearls from the Muddy Hollow‘s nine tracks make a suitable companion piece to Steak‘s 2014 full-length debut, Slab City, which basks in a similar mindset. That’s not to say Palm Desert bring nothing of their own to the style — both the quick “Rise Above” and extended closer “Forward in the Sun” branch beyond idolatry to an individualized moment — just that the resounding impression throughout Pearls from the Muddy Hollow is Kyuss loyalism.\nEach and every track on this album is crafted with what makes every Stonerhead listen to this kind of music : First a killer voice, strong and punchy but also sweet and melodious when needed. Then take the most badass riff you can, play it smoothly, then little by little, build heavier layers of that same riff, feeling the fuzz take you from the inside…and…BAM! They BLAST you with an even more ferocious riff!  And of course Stoner Rock isn’t called “Stoner” for nothing! Yep, Palm Desert are also kings when it comes to playing mind-blowing psychedelic moments, repetitive riffs full of reverb and delay on top of groovy bass lines, free-flowing guitar solos, spacey vocals, all of this being so relaxing and calming when smoking some of your best weed.  Simply one of the best Desert Rock albums of all time.\n1.  No Way Back - 0:00\n2.  Lucky Bone - 5:02\n3.  Tsunami - 8:18\n4.  Favela - 11:46\n5.  End Of The Road - 19:36\n6.  Rise Above - 23:39\n7.

            "summary": "Palm Desert - Pearls From The Muddy Hollow (Full Album) Perhaps unsurprising when one considers they take their name from the hometown of California’s ’90s desert rock movement, but Poland’s Palm Desert owe a large sonic debt to Kyuss. In the four-piece’s style of riffing, tonality and propensity for the occasional stoner jam on their third album, Pearls from the Muddy Hollow, they show their allegiance to the desert style and its blend of fuzzed-up punk and laid back psychedelia.  Vocalist Wojciech Gauszka helps change things up, however, with some elements of Soundgarden-era Chris Cornell to go with periodic John Garcia gruffness, so that Pearls from the Muddy Hollow‘s nine tracks make a suitable companion piece to Steak‘s 2014 full-length debut, Slab City, which basks in a similar mindset. That’s not to say Palm Desert bring nothing of their own to the style — both the quick “Rise Above” and extended closer “Forward in the Sun” branch beyond idolatry to an individualized moment — just that the resounding impression throughout Pearls from the Muddy Hollow is Kyuss loyalism.",

Into The Acid Swamp is the first full-length from these guys, after teasing us with several singles in 2013. Soak in the acid-tingle, low-tuned fuzz of these ten weedian tracks! Fans of Belzebong and Bongzilla should love this.  Sleep-like weedian instrumental grooves aided and abetted by cleverly placed soundbytes.  Light one up and enjoy!",
